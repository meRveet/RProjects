# RProjects
These are some projects that I've done while doing through John Hopkins' Data Science Course.
The capstone project was to come out with a mock swift key application and files can be found in the "MockSwiftkeyApp" folder. Alternatively, if you are interested in trying out the application that I have created. The application is made from a very small dataset from (blog, news and tweets), hence they predicted text may not be highly accurate. You can visit the link over [here](https://merveet.shinyapps.io/SwiftkeyApp/).
