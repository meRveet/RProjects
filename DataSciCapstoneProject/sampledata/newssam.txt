It still takes a corporate headquarters out of Baltimore, and as EDF officials have pointed out, it greatly diminishes the chances for the construction of a new nuclear reactor at Calvert Cliffs and will almost certainly result in the loss of high-paying jobs here. But the criteria on which the Public Service Commission can judge this deal are narrow: Does it provide benefits for BGE customers, does it produce no harm for them, and is it in the public interest? With the terms Mr. O'Malley secured, the commission should be able to answer all three in the affirmative.

If he is, than that has to be the world's highest radar level. Right now, if you're underestimating Edwin's scoring ability than you either don't care or aren't paying attention.

In the last two games, he is 9-of-13 from 3-point range and is an absolute nightmare on the fast-break. He was really locked down in the second half by DePaul — something which we expect he'll see more of — but to be honest, Edwin's probably eclipsed Herb Pope as the second scoring option for this year. For now, at least.

Trout's blazing speed will make him an asset to fantasy teams. And as it's been said before, speed never goes into a slump.

John Davis, a former aide to John Edwards, testified about bungled efforts to keep the former presidential candidate's affair with videographer Rielle Hunter hidden from staff, including an awkward encounter when Hunter showed up at a hotel weeks after her work filming Edwards had ended. Hunter's contract with the campaign wasn't renewed at the end of 2006, Davis said. But in February 2007, he ran into her in an elevator at the candidate's Detroit hotel, and shortly afterward she told him she and Edwards were in love, Davis testified at Edwards' federal corruption trial.
6. Alan Rickman/Severus Snape: If ever a villain in an action movie deserved an Oscar nod, it was Rickman for his classic turn as Hans Gruber in the original "Die Hard."

"Monster House" was shot with the same motion-capture process that was used in Mr. Zemeckis's "Polar Express," a process I didn't like then and don't like now, even though advancements have been made in its area of obvious weakness, immobile faces. "Monster House" benefits from strong graphic design and lovely lighting, but the script is nothing to write home about. It focuses on three neighborhood kids, reminiscent of the trio in "Harry Potter," who dare to penetrate the house in an effort to tame it. By the time they've survived a succession of standard-brand terrors done with visual flair, they understand what every homeowner already knows -- a house can eat you alive.

"Anatomy of A Champion" - That's one of former Pacifica Tribune sports writer Mychael Urban's headlines that referenced Natalia Jonas in her junior year of high school.

Rep. Fortney "Pete" Stark, D-Calif., was next in line for the post and held it a day, until Democrats decided they didn't want one of their most confrontational members -- Stark once accused Republicans of wanting to send troops to Iraq "to get their heads blown off for the amusement of the president" -- in such a high-profile job when their party already is under assault from voters.

"For a while I was doing a Rolling Stones cover band with my wife Tammy Faye Starlight, and then we started doing the Who covers thing.

Executing prisoners who "volunteer" by declining appeals is actually good policy. Prisoners, properly advised, may competently choose not to exercise constitutional rights. They have not "volunteered" for the death penalty, that decision was made by a judge and a jury, based on evidence in a courtroom. In a state where we allow competent patients to choose physician-assisted death, and where we allow citizens to decline life support when facing terminal illnesses, how can we decline similar autonomy to prisoners? The governor is concerned that the system is expensive. But that is the cost of protecting the public interest in assuring publicly provided safeguards. And whether that expense is justified arguably needs to be viewed through the eyes of the victims' families. Perhaps, as well, we might measure cost by comparison to a state retirement system that pays a football coach $500,000 per year.

And it would help with his third big challenge—defense. Team Romney is now turning its big guns on the former senator, who has benefited by staying above the Romney-Gingrich fray. The Santorum folks are betting Mr. Romney is getting a reputation for slash-and-burn, and that this will hurt him. He is, and it will, but the attacks won't stop. And criticism that is left unanswered has a way of seeping into voters' minds.

We’re told that “The Hunger Games” is an Orwellian takedown of brutal authoritarian governments, that it satirizes our obsession with television and fame. One reviewer praised the early scenes (set in an impoverished West Virginia-like area) for having the quality of Dorothea Lange portraits of the Great Depression. Another praised the movie as implicitly backing the 99 percenters against the 1 percent. We’re told that the movie shows us, in metaphor, how badly we mistreat our children.

"So to me, it's never worth it. I mean, you've got to figure out ways to use the rules to your advantage, and figure out ways to make the most of everything. We've got new work rules (CBA) about what he can and can't do with our players, and we're going to make the most of it. What we're finding out is that ... man, we can do something even better than we did before, because these rules make us focus on some things we didn't do before.

Be likable: A tough assignment for some, that's for sure. But Cialdini's research has found that a little easygoing pleasantness can be just as persuasive as talent or actual ability.

"There's Something About Mary" (1998): Usually cited as the Farrelly brothers' best movie (though some of us have a soft spot for "Kingpin"), the story follows Ted (Ben Stiller), who has long loved Mary (Cameron Diaz). He gets another shot at dating her 13 years after a hilariously disastrous prom date. But Healy (Matt Dillon), the private detective Ted hires to follow Mary, falls for her, too. What makes the movie work is the stars' willingness to do anything for a laugh; think of the hair-gel scene for proof.

If Congress fails to extend the current payroll tax cut, taxes will go up on millions of people at a time when families are struggling to make ends meet. That's unacceptable, as a typical household earning $50,000 a year will see their taxes increase by $1,000. But if Congress passes the proposal laid out by President Obama, the typical family earning $50,000 a year would see that tax cut continued, and receive more than $500 additionally — for a total tax cut of $1,500. It makes absolutely no sense to raise taxes on the middle class at a time when so many are still trying to get back on their feet and we see positive signs in growth and falling unemployment.

Here were highly sophisticated conservative thinkers - lawyers and justices - making the case for limited government, and liberals weren't even prepared for the obvious constitutional question: If Congress can force the individual into a private contract by authority of the Commerce Clause, what can it not force the individual to do?

Bradford is the real deal. He runs the Rams’ offense and can make any throw and deliver the long ball with touch. For a young player, he runs the no-huddle offense pretty effectively. Because of the Rams’ no-huddle approach, Reed will be a key in getting the secondary set. He'll also have plenty of tricks for Bradford and might be able to come away with an interception or two.

The Sacramento show will be especially memorable because of a couple of connections that Tech N9ne holds with the city. First, he signed Sacramento native Brotha Lynch Hung to his Strange Music record label back in 2009. Second, he drafted Sacramento's Chino Moreno and Stephen Carpenter of the Deftones for the song "If I Could," a surprisingly stripped-down but climactic rock-rap hybrid that appeared on the album "All 6's and 7's" (noted by Spin magazine last year as a top summer release).

Where was I? Oh, yes: the world's all-time coldest wind chill. That's what you're going to be feeling at this point in an Obama second term. If you like his contempt for judicial review, parliamentary scrutiny and representative democracy now, wait'll you see how "flexible" he'll get starting in January 2013. The CFPB appointment is not a small thing. Indeed, its new director, one Richard Cordray, embodies what's gone so disastrously wrong with American government: you'll have to be in compliance with him, but he doesn't have to be in compliance with anybody, whether the Senate or the Constitution. As I say somewhere in my recent book, you don't need a president-for-life if you've got a bureaucracy-for-life. More and more aspects of the citizen's daily existence are regulated by rules and officials both of which are ever more disconnected from any meaningful accountability to the people's representatives. As the president says, look for even more "flexibility" in a second term: more non-recess recess appointments, more executive orders, more bewildering innovations from the commissars of the hyper-regulatory state.

After a few too many drinks that night, he delivered tea to their room and, with a gun to Gwenda's head, insisted they drink.
“I’m not surprised he’s not running again because the word on the street was that he wasn’t re-electable,” Olson said of Hoffman. “It’ll be good for the city to have a new mayor and someone who isn't such a lightning rod for this divisiveness that has been pervasive in our community for the last few years."
The decision to end "Desperate Housewives" was more difficult than most because over the years it had faltered creatively, then rebounded, only to falter again. The series was creatively uneven as early as Season 2, which was much reviled for its weaker writing and plotting, including another murder mystery on tiny Wisteria Lane, so cursed that it might have been built over an Indian burial mound.

At its most basic, it’s the story of the people’s fickle love, and a patrician’s discomfort with the rough-and-tumble of pragmatic politics. A dense, thoughtful exploration of themes Shakespeare explored in plays from “Richard II” to “Julius Caesar,” it’s difficult drama with a thoroughly unlikable protagonist at its core.

By 1984, soft drink companies in the United States had replaced sugar with HFCS in their drinks and the cheaper cost eventually allowed them to sell far bigger bottles at fractionally higher cost to the customer. This led to a huge increase in overall soda consumption: rising more than 60 percent from 1977 to 1997 and doubling in children over that same period.

As they prepare the day's menu -- donated soup from Olive Garden, macaroni salad from Nike, fresh baked biscuits, vegetable trays (another day it is salmon pasta from the kitchen at the University of Portland, garlic bread; always there are pastries or pies from Costco, bottomless cups of coffee) -- a man climbs the steps, looking for a place out of the rain and the cold. He carries an old plastic bag crammed with clothing, his fingers dotted with sores. "Would you like something to drink?" Candice asks. He doesn't answer, just sits for a few minutes, crying and talking to himself. Eventually, volunteer Dell Zimmerman coaxes him into helping her hang fall decorations around the inside of the bus, and soon, he loses himself in the act of tearing precise strips of tape, prettying the space for everyone who will soon climb aboard.

Through the years of the Handbook one of the easiest players to predict each season has to be Albert Pujols. There's a reason why ESPN had him standing at a Xerox machine for his commercial. The back of his baseball card consists of a Topps intern going ctrl-A, ctrl-C, ctrl-V 11 times over. It's no different for 2012. Despite the much-publicized downward trends for the $250-million man, Pujols is still predicted to hit his marks: .316/.414/.591 with a 1.005 OPS, 41 homers and 120 RBIs. James' predictions, of course, veer beyond the standard stats. The Handbook projects that Pujols will have 144 runs created (RC) and
Every year I imagine Maybin being at least four years older than he actually is. He may have been around forever, but did you know he just turned 25 earlier this month? Last year, in his breakout campaign with the Padres, he proved he could run, swiping 40 bags. He's got 4 so far this year, but his low batting average has kept him from exploiting his speed further. A low BABIP and a higher-than-ever walk rate suggests he'll be completely fine. Maybin was a 13th-round pick this preseason, but I believe he could be had for 18th- or 19th-round type players in a trade such as Colby Rasmus or Matt Joyce. Find the fed-up owner then pounce.

What makes our market different, we're called a producer-only market because we ask our vendors to only have items that are home grown, handmade and homemade.

Most days it can feel like if we only had enough time, we could do a much better job at being healthy. Sound familiar? We’d have enough time for a proper breakfast; we’d have time to pack a healthy lunch and prepare a nourishing dinner; we’d carve out downtime for ourselves plus time to connect with friends and loved ones; and time for exercise. Yet we usually end up cutting corners for our well-being throughout the day, but still end up spending ever more hours in front of the computer and television out of exhaustion, lack of energy or seeking a way to connect.

Over time, we learned that the use of interrogation techniques that we had long deemed torture or abuse were being widely used — and, shockingly, were approved at the highest levels of our government.

In fact, the proposed future Big East has three teams ranked in the top 25 — one more than the current Big East.

A pit bull is not inherently human aggressive, this was bred out of them years go; biting a human is an anomaly, not the norm.

Gov. Martin O'Malley may not have gotten Exelon to bump up the $100 rate credit it promised to Baltimore Gas and Electric customers as part of its proposed merger with Constellation Energy, but he secured concessions that will be far more valuable to Maryland ratepayers in the long run. The settlement the governor plans to announce Thursday includes a vastly greater commitment to renewable energy and other new power generation than Exelon had ever agreed to before. It contains millions to help improve energy efficiency and assist low-income customers who have trouble paying their bills. And it is likely to produce substantially more short-term and permanent jobs than the energy company's initial proposal.

After more than two decades — and a Neil Young-meets-Velvet Underground style enshrined on the 1988 classic, “The Trinity Sessions” — Canada’s Cowboy Junkies keep evolving. The first in a series of conceptual albums, “Renmin Park” is based on guitarist-songwriter Michael Timmins’ three-month visit to China with his family (including children adopted from China). Soaking up a village’s sounds, he wrote a suite of songs about divided lovers. The album incorporates field recordings and more Chinese-style fiddling than guitar solos. However unlikely this concept album might be, the leap of imagination and empathy is remarkable. The group’s big-sky moodiness remains, too, as do Margo Timmins’ darkly sensual vocals.
As a life-long nerd, I am all too aware of what happens if the kids think you are different. Names and worse could be thrown at you for the rest of your school life. At least I don't have to worry about physical harm coming to him any time soon; I may have cursed him with a horrible 'shy" gene, but I also blessed him with a "bigger than everyone else in class and possibly the whole school" gene. And yes, this does make you stick out in a crowd (the nerd's worse nightmare), but it also makes bullies rethink beating you up. They can't punch out your teeth if they can't reach up high enough to hit your chin.
Finally, dessert, which even comes with a lighting change. The dessert is a Meyer lemon pot de creme with lime shortbread that crumbles on my tongue like a sand castle. For garnish, David has crafted mini mice out of chocolate. He can't wait to show me. I am running out of adjectives. I write this down in my notebook: "Oh, good God."

Finally, t Mr. Owen thinks that the law of self defense was taken to a ridiculous extreme. Well, I am sure that if it were him availing himself of the law it would seem just fine.

To paraphrase the words of Winston Churchill, who is seen in newsreel footage of the Potsdam Peace Conference in "The Good German," Steven Soderbergh's new film is a puzzle wrapped in a mystery inside a perversity. The puzzle is Mr. Soderbergh's approach to what might have been an intriguing experiment, rather than the off-putting one it turned out to be.
The stymied Serb smashed his racket, scolded himself and threw up his hands in surrender. He won four games in that first set but never once looked comfortable. Never once looked like the man who handled Roger Federer just two nights before.
"Obviously, we're not a very tall team, with me being the tallest player on the team at 5-8 or 5-9," said Roosevelt outside hitter Erin Seele, who registered 11 kills. "I don't think it was so much their height because we're used to that, but they just had a good rhythm going."
The changes that Donahoe are proposing would mean a different post office, but one that still operates for people such as Jovita Camesa, who's 75 and lives in a downtown Los Angeles retirement complex. She said she's sending more first-class mail than ever due to her expanding circle of grandchildren.
When volunteer Jerry Keller of Brooklyn Center was dropped off by his childhood home on Willow Avenue N., he didn't recognize the once-wooded street, now nearly treeless. "I didn't know where I was at first."

In 1971, Britten moved to Caltech and began a quarter-century collaboration with Davidson. The pair demonstrated how repetitive and single-copy DNA are organized in animal genomes, measured the amount of single-copy DNA in genes that are expressed (turned on) during embryonic development and began the analysis of gene regulatory systems that underlie development. They found that only about 5% of single-copy DNA was actually genes.
Jackson "had it all. . . . talent, grace, professionalism and dedication," said Quincy Jones, Jackson's collaborator on his most important albums and the movie "The Wiz."

"But it's a process and sometimes I've got to slow myself down and remember that he is young and he doesn't have a lot of experience. I'm talking about a finished product in Ben Wallace and not the first stages. I think that DJ can certainly get there. He has a little ways to go, but he's locked into trying to get there and that's the most important thing."
3. Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino: Remember when Mike was the star of the show? It was his catchphrases — not Pauly D’s — that “Jersey Shore” fans were quoting. And in case anyone thinks his material was planned ahead of time, he demonstrated his spontaneity when I asked him at Lumen in the West Loop in February 2010 if Ronnie and Sammi’s on-again-off-again relationship would ruin the show. “I run that house,” Sorrentino said. “(Ronnie and Sammi) are the cartoon section. I’m the front page.”

The corruption that surfaced in the Bo case is hardly unique to Chongqing. Kenneth Lieberthal, a China expert at the Brookings Institution, says that similar patronage networks operate across the country. Top party officials use their relatives to collect bribes, through payments to law firms or private equity firms, much as Bo did with his wife. Even the most respected officials, such as President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao, are said to have close relatives whose behavior is questionable.
Herbert also targeted the credibility of the family, telling jurors that he would prove that the boy had a history of fabricating stories — including that his own father abused him — and a history of violence.
Black carp The biggest of the Asian carp and the last to arrive in the U.S., they can grow to 150 pounds. While young black carp feed on zooplankton and insect larvae, the large adults feed primarily on mollusks. The zebra mussels and quagga mussels of Lake Erie and the Great Lakes would be a smorgasbord for them.
The bartender told us Judy's doesn't allow customers to start tabs, so it was good that I had taken some cash out at the ATM earlier. Also, it was good that I had won $3.74 at a slot machine.
Sandblasting lead paint from the metal tower and applying a fresh coat of paint could cost $150,000 to $200,000, said village Engineer Randy Burk. Just repainting would be $90,000, he said.

In Ed Riffle's letter ("Diversion tactic", April 13 Milpitas Post) he refers to the people involved in the recall of Councilwoman Althea Polanski and Councilman Armando Gomez. Mr. Riffle, of course, did not include himself as one of those people. But he is definitely one of the recall perpetrators; and I will support that statement by citing several public facts and associations of Mr. Riffle.
The appeal of the Mexican market, he said, is the fastidious habits of its borrowers. He said only about 7% of his customers in Mexico forfeited their merchandise, compared with about 25% in the United States.

Ahearn established the NCAA Division I career free throw accuracy record (.946) during his 2003-07 career at Missouri State.
Polian on Richardson: "He's got incredible skills, skills that are comparable to Emmitt Smith. But he's incredibly fast. In addition to that, he has a fire and drive that not only gain yards but ignites your football team. People like to play with him. Special running backs can do that, and I really believe he's special. That's a cold-weather division: You've got to run the ball.''
The debate revealed what the public cannot have failed to notice in a long election campaign: The two men have polar opposite views of how to deal with just about everything. They butt heads over how to counter the effects of the global economic crisis — Hollande supports higher taxes and encouraging growth, Sarkozy austerity cuts and savings — how to lower an unemployment rate that hovers just under 10%, an 11-year high, and how to reduce public debt that has seen France lose its triple-A credit rating.

"I haven't blocked any yet, but I will. Coming soon, I'm going to block some," he said from his home in Texas. "I know who Kendall Hunter is. He's from East Texas too, so I know exactly who he is. But I like Brandon Jacobs. He's a good running back and so is Frank Gore. I look up to him. I think he's an awesome running back. I think he's one of the best running backs in the league. So, if I have to sit behind him and learn, it's just a good opportunity for me to get better."
"We could fill the Pepsi Center every year with students who can't read and are on track to drop out of school," Spence said, rattling of state assessment statistics that more than a fourth of Colorado's third-graders aren't reading at grade level.
Since coming together in Dayton nearly 30 years ago, Guided by Voices has endured despite more employee turnover than a fast-food franchise. "Let's Go Eat the Factory," the quintessential indie-rock group's 16th album (and first since a 2004 "farewell" tour), reunites mainstay frontman Robert Pollard with the band's mid-'90s lineup, including multi-instrumentalist Tobin Sprout. A few tracks feel more like fragments than proper songs, but GBV fans will find plenty to rejoice about here, including "Laundry and Lasers," the Krispy Kreme-plugging "Doughnut for a Snowman" and "The Unsinkable Fats Domino," a stomper about invincibility. Grade: B+
“By and large, profits for the oil industry are going to be enormous,” said James DiGeorgia, founder and publisher of the Gold and Energy Advisor, in Boca Raton, Fla. “If the U.S. economy picks up steam, we could easily see oil prices at $115 to $120 a barrel later this year.”

USA Today takes a look at the impact of the continuing NBA lockout on Nike, Adidas and Under Armour, something The Oregonian and the Portland Business Journal did awhile back. But for The Oregonian story, Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst of the NPD Group, did not state this potential impact if the season is wiped out: The NBA, he said, could lose up to $500 million in sales if the season is cancelled. Matt Powell of SportsOneSource -- who along with Cohen is the most-often quoted sneaker expert for these types of stories -- disagrees. Powell seems to agree with the Nike Lockout-era campaign slogan of "Basketball Never Stops."

Rather than serve fish in curry, Manja stylishly plates first-rate white pomfret steaks over pools of Malay-style curry sauce. Their base of freshly crushed aromatics (garlic, shallots, lemon grass, chiles) called a rempah gives these mixtures their light, clean taste. Ginger-like fresh galangal slices and slivers of preserved lime add further dimension to nasi kari ikan. The fish, propped up with a lemon-grass stalk, is surrounded with crisp bright green okra pods and cherry tomatoes. The sauce for nasi ikan masak lemak, another pomfret dish, sits in a rich chile-infused coconut milk.

Wallace Huffman, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University, says research suggests that more than 50 percent of the nation's farming and related industries employ illegal immigrants, largely from Mexico.

Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and celery and saute until tender but not browned, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Pour the vegetables over the bread.
Caine probably did half a dozen films like this during his youth -- one of the best, the modernist-before-its-time "Gambit," actually played out its robbery twice, once as perfect daydream, then as awkward reality. And Caine brings his own slightly seedy Cockney charm to his part as the taken-for-granted employee, the worm who finally turns.

But it didn't happen that way, as you've probably guessed. It doesn't really sound like my style, does it? My call has come in a series of fits and starts, through unexpected opportunities and affirmations, and through my own desire to keep putting one foot in front of the other in obedience. And somehow, those steps have led me into a strange new world. It's certainly strange to be taking classes for the first time in 24 years. I'm sorry to say that my self-discipline regarding homework hasn't improved much; I still turn in assignments at the last possible moment. But it's even stranger to be entering what I think of as "Clergy World". By nature or habit, I am contrary and anti-institutional. I'm skeptical of those in power, and have trouble towing the party line (in any party). I keep asking myself, "Can I fit into this world without becoming someone else?" I don't know, honestly. I could fret about whether I'll even get through the first round of interviews for my district license, but what would be the point? Listening to the voice of the Spirit has gotten me this far, and I'll just keep going - one foot in front of the other - unless something stops me. I don't want to ever, ever become someone who gives an answer because I think it's what those in authority want to hear. No king but Jesus. I'm working toward ordination, but ordination is not the ultimate goal. Faithfulness to God is the goal.
"Most of the other cities surveyed don't have a mall as big as ours relative to the size of our city as a whole, so that might be one reason why other cities don't have a similar arrangement," Graham said.
Still, there will be tickets on the market, says Tom Patania, owner of Select-A-Ticket. The first wave will be now until game time Friday, when fans and alums like Haber will be trying to find a way in to the game.

Something must give, considering that we face a budget deficit of $8.4 billion to $10 billion. State workers and taxpayers have to make painful sacrifices. We have no choice.
Even with a major character and the foundation of its (admittedly flimsy) plot missing, "Pirates" lives pretty well from gag to gag, nearly achieving its Monty Python meets "Treasure Island" potential. There are genius moments here. The pirate ship features coin-op cannons, a surprisingly curvaceous mate with a hilariously transparent fake beard never arouses suspicion, and Joseph Merrick pops in for a brief Elephant Man cameo. There are flat stretches as well (Salma Hayek and Jeremy Piven underwhelm as villainous rival Pirate of the Year contestants). Still, I emitted more "Harrrs" than "Arrghs."

NBA teams win consistently at home, at a 60.7 percent clip going into the final games Wednesday. Teams shoot better at home due to familiarity with the floor, the lighting, the rims and so forth. The Cavs average 102.2 points at home, a couple of critical buckets more than on the road.

Among them are the Toyota RAV4 and 4Runner, the Jeep Wrangler Unlimited, Nissan Xterra and the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon (which come in versions with two rows of seats). A full-size spare is standard on all those models, but on the RAV4 you lose the spare when you buy the optional Sport Appearance Package. A full-size spare is optional on the Jeep Grand Cherokee and also on the Compass and Patriot, though with the latter two you have to buy the Freedom Drive II off-road package.
Hospital charges appear on patients' bills, but they often bear no relation to the discounted fees that an insurer will end up paying. Still, some patients do get stuck paying the retail price.

"While the president acknowledged last week that Arizonans are justifiably fed up with inaction, filing a lawsuit is counterproductive to his statements of appealing to the American people's highest ideals to create a sensible and workable immigration policy.

The value of the U.S. dollar surged Tuesday on China's rate news. But analysts don't think that spike will last. More important, they say, is if Beijing is trying to use its rate decision to signal that it will let its currency rise in value. Many in the U.S. complain that China keeps its currency artificially low, driving sales of its imports to the United States but hurting U.S. exports sold in China.

Indeed, at 112 minutes, "Reunion" is easily the series' longest entry, largely because it feels the need to cross-reference and embellish anything even remotely memorable from the prior three films.

The so-called stand your ground law asserts that a person has no duty to retreat when facing an attacker and has a right to use deadly force if he "reasonably" believes he or others are threatened with death or great bodily harm. It also grants "true immunity" from civil and criminal charges. This means a judge can use this law to dismiss a case before it goes to trial, and also that Florida prosecutors are less likely to pursue homicide cases against people who claim they acted in self-defense. The St. PetersburgTimes performed a search of Florida newspapers and turned up 93 cases in which the law could have been applied from 2005 to 2010, and found that 57 of them never went to trial.

This hasn't been as breezy as a morning skate, either. As usual the Blues have been threatened by injuries. Hitchcock has coached the Blues for 54 games, and among the forwards Alex Steen has played in only 23 of the 54, McDonald 13 of the 54, Matt D'Agostini 39 of the 54 and David Perron 42 of the 54.

Recent polling on actual candidate preference shows Romney closing the gap with Obama – and in some case pulling slightly ahead. (RealClearPolitics' averaging of major polls has the two in a statistical dead heat.) Romney's challenge now is to build on the momentum boost he got from Rick Santorum dropping out – and to turn around some of his negative impressions.

The lack of a primary challenge to Mr. Obama may also be because many loyal Democrats have an appreciation not seen elsewhere of the difficult hand dealt to him by unforeseen circumstances and the dedicated obstructionism of the other party.

Its first list, published in 2002, got a lot of publicity, so the foundation trademarked the term.

WASHINGTON (AP) — For the better part of a year, Mitt Romney has tethered himself to an array of positions designed for the Republican presidential primaries, stances that put him to the right of where he's been through much of his career and raise questions about where he really wants to go. President Barack Obama's politicking has tacked to the left, thanks to all those speeches to Democratic fundraisers and other activist-heavy events that play up the liberal in him.

The guanciale has wonderful flavors of cured pork cheek with tender ricotta and a dusting of fennel powder. But my favorite so far has been the carciofini, topped with ricotta and marinated artichokes. They've got a calzone, a half moon practically big as a leg of lamb, stuffed with burrata and escarole accented with Gaeta olives and capers.

Unfortunately, if we don't care about the title character, it's impossible to follow his amorous adventures with interest. By the time he has seduced his way through a few boudoirs, the plot has lost its punch. To be sure, the play's frank, once-shocking sexuality now seems tame.

There was no way we would pass up the works of Picasso, Miró, Gaudí or the historic sites in Spain. But I knew we'd need to break up the museums and tours with other activities.

The playoffs still seem a bit of a stretch. The Cavaliers will have to catch either the re-energized New York Knicks or Boston Celtics and hold off the Milwaukee Bucks.

I applaud them for that, but I cannot applaud their new film, "The Three Stooges: The Movie," a muddled mess of bad writing and clumsy staging. Instead of sharp comedy timing, it wallows in a series of comic duds and thuds, its awfulness matched only by its dreadfulness.

The original focus, since softened, was on strict, back-to-basics education — hence the name "fundamental."

The department earned re-accreditation from the agency in March and the police academy also earned accreditation that month. Now, the department is seeking to have its communications department accredited.
State lawmakers appear to be waiting for the California Supreme Court to resolve the disagreements in the lower courts, which would clear away some of the haze. But regardless of what the justices decide, there will still be major issues to resolve. The Legislature should stop waiting and fill in the many blanks in medical marijuana laws. That won't resolve the basic conflict between state and federal governments regarding marijuana, but at least it will clarify what the state's policy is.
Edward DeMarco, acting director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, has been studying expanded incentives offered earlier this year by the Obama administration, which wants the mortgage-finance firms to reduce borrowers' loan balances. The two government-controlled companies, which buy up loans and package them for investors, don't currently do so.

But 4 is hardly the provocative statement of a superstar experimenting and spreading her wings. Instead, it finds Beyoncé taking care to play to her strengths - by playing it safe.
"These smaller- to medium-sized acquisitions with a focus on specific pipeline projects … rather than mega-mergers are likely to continue to be on the agenda of the big pharma companies," said Britta Holt, an analyst with Fitch Ratings Limited in a research note about GlaxoSmithKline's interest in Human Genome.

While "On the Road to Freedom" is a travel guide, organized by destination, with street addresses for historic sites, it is also full of stories. Some are known to every schoolchild -- Rosa Parks' refusal to give her seat on the bus to a white passenger, for example -- but others will be new to many readers, such as a 1944 incident in which a black woman named Irene Morgan was jailed for refusing to yield her seat on a Greyhound bus headed from Virginia to Maryland. The conflict led the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down segregated seating on interstate travel.
The tour is considered the oldest continuously operated amateur cycling race in the nation. It typically draws about 10,000 fans to Somerville each year.
"It's been nice working on who Monroe is, what works, and what doesn't, what we want it to be, and what we don't want it to be. We don't want it to be shticky, or campy, or funny for funny's sake. It's a guy who lives in the world, and who's got issues and is involved with this other guy who's got major issues. As outlandish as it is, and demands of the story structure notwithstanding, it's important that behavior is rooted in some kind of truth, and I think the writers have been very honest about that."
Contract status/Impact of new CBA: Will make $12.6 million in the second of a five-year, $62.5 million deal. A new CBA should have little immediate impact.

It is San Francisco's first four-game skid since Sept. 22-25 last year — and its first at home since dropping four in a row from Sept. 3-10 last year. The Giants were just swept by the Miami Marlins, losing all three by one run.
Milton served on the Ramsey County board and as a DFL state senator, which may account for the heavy load of inside-baseball details. To those of us immersed in the game, the play-by-play is high drama, but "normal" readers could get by with less.

It's outrageous that contractors were told to bid way low and then come in with costly change orders later. It's a taxpayer rip-off and unfair to honest contractors. We need to require contractors to show that they can deliver the project for the price quoted. Changes over 1 percent should require a high-level administrative review, and changes above 5 percent should require approval by the council and executive.
He's on pace to graduate in December 2013 but said he'll likely spread the workload. Another positive: perspective on injuries.
As of Tuesday, the employee union and the city had not yet agreed on who will take the neutral seat at the bargaining table, said Encinitas City Attorney Glen Sabine. They have until Friday to do so.
The site also includes a lot of other information about travelers' health. And although much of it is pretty much of the "any idiot" variety ("avoid insect bites" and such), you will find some of the warnings well worth your attention. Note especially any reports of contagious disease outbreaks.
Miller being one of the best points in the NBA, especially on Monday night, has helped LaMarcus Aldridge become one of the best power forwards in the NBA. On this night, Miller helped Aldridge set his new career-high of 42 points by assisting on 7 of Aldridge's 15 made field goals. And many of the 14 free throw attempts Aldridge was awarded were direct results of Miller putting the ball in Aldridge's hands at right time.

When I tapped one of those artists, Nina Simone, a similar panel slid into view with her information, with the Aretha panel moving to the left of the screen. You can continue to display or peel back these overlapping panels. There is the danger that this can get out of hand, with one panel on top of another on top of another, but this approach worked for me. I like how you get a quick progression of artists, the people who influenced them and quick access to many of the songs you'll almost certainly want to play on the spot.
The bus driver, Wei Wang, 50, of Forest Hills, N.Y., was hurled 15 feet through the windshield after the second collision and was pronounced dead at the scene, State Police said.

At Convention Hall, we got that L train rumble. But that's all we got, and there's a heck of a lot more to Company Flow than menacing sound. The emcees didn't seem to mind the bad mix at ATP, and it's not El-P's style to make demands of the crowd. Like many underground emcees, he leads with self-deprecation. His manifestos are all tucked away in the rhymes. That is not how Public Enemy rolls. This is a hip-hop band with a Minister of Information in it, and Chuck D has made his name by being outspoken and clarifying things for his listeners. He stuck up for Company Flow and all the other word men with "He Got Game," a song that articulates a viewpoint that could be the antithesis of everything All Tomorrow's Parties stands for. "It might feel good/ it might sound a little something," rhymed Chuck, "but damn the game if it ain't saying nothing."

Not so in the 34th District Democratic primary. Four of the candidates are longtime neighbors in Chicago's tight-knit 6th Ward, living in Chatham or Chesterfield, neighborhoods that have struggled recently but long have been synonymous with Chicago's black middle class. Three of them also work for the Chicago Police Department.
More measured voices have pointed out that most sex crimes in Britain are committed by white men. But some say there is a specific problem in northern English communities, where a toxic combination of alienated men and vulnerable, unsupervised girls has allowed exploitation to flourish.

“There was a committee that selected the broker,” said Mary Caffrey, who was township administrator in 2007 and served as part of the group. “We had had problems with our prior broker, both billing issues and some significant customer service problems.”
If a friendship has lasted a lifetime, it should have a basis of affection and respect, so trust those. Talk with your son about situations that arise. If the older friend wants to do something or go somewhere that is not age-appropriate for your son, offer to be the bad guy so your son can save face and say, "I'd love to, but my over-protective parents won't let me!"

When "The Raven" finally gets around to revealing its mastermind, the bad guy is like an after-thought, as if the filmmakers suddenly realized they needed to unmask the killer and cast the first mildly menacing actor who walked through the door.

At a Las Vegas rally later Wednesday, Romney criticized the Obama administration's decision to announce that U.S. and other international forces in Afghanistan plan to end their combat role in 2013 and continue a training and advisory role with Afghan forces through the next year. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta laid out the administration position to reporters while traveling to a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels.
"People need to assess where they are and look for something that makes them feel divine, aside from spirituality or religion, just give them a sense of freedom," he says. "At this point, the world needs that levity more than ever."
Fatalities aside, groups like the American Automobile Association argue that New York City's arterial roadways are still undeniably outdated, in poor shape and lacking important features. For example, the lack of breakdown lanes on many highways means every time someone gets a flat, you block a lane of traffic and get a huge tie-up.
We are on the cusp of a change that the hard-line approach doesn't acknowledge. Unless Arizona begins to recognize the nature of the change and act on an emerging new reality, our state will miss opportunities.
If I were to create a cocktail that embodies Wicker Park, the nutty neighborhood I call home, it would be some combination of PBR, musician sweat and tattoo ink, with a splash of expensive beer and an artful garnish of skinny jeans and plaid.Thomas Kleiner had something else in mind. Challenged to concoct a drink that represents Wicker Park and Bucktown, the general manager of Club Lucky came up with a 10-ingredient allegory of the neighborhood’s ethnic history and summer activities, served with a participatory painting installation on the side.
Thibodeau rode Kyle Korver down the stretch, playing him the entire fourth quarter. Hamilton, who logged 26 minutes, 30 seconds, watched Korver score eight of his 12 points in the fourth.
Gin: Plymouth ($22, 750ml) wins out. It's a real gin, stands tall and proud with a goodly dash of perfume behind its ears, and it doesn't give you whiplash when you use it in a martini. It's also as versatile as all heck when used in cocktailian pursuits, so buy Plymouth if one brand of gin is all you need.

That should have been enough. Instead, Councilman Ed Reyes, joined by Councilman Eric Garcetti, proposed a temporary moratorium on the issuance of any demolition or building permits in Chinatown for any chain store until the city can study the implications of the proposed project. If the council approves the moratorium, Wal-Mart will be asked to produce studies and endure delay for a proposal that already meets the city's rules and objectives.

Supermarkets such as Ralph’s owner Kroger Co., Safeway, Supervalu and more have dominoed over one another to announce their abandonment of the product. Several school districts have banned it from their cafeterias.
In George Orwell’s “1984” (first adapted into a film in 1956), all thought is slickly controlled under the watchful eye of the big state’s Big Brother. In “Brazil” (1985), a totalitarian yet ludicrously inefficient bureaucracy labors just to keep everything in a constant state of disrepair.
"The letter is factually incorrect," she wrote. "Greenleaf submitted its application for a permit and has been asked for additional information, which we have yet to receive. Its application is still under review so it is premature to consider issuing a permit."
But some council members worried about scaring away tourists. Deputy Mayor Jack Wichterman suggested allowing smoking on a third of the beach.
Although it's an attractive option, it's something less than a comprehensive guarantee.
With more females carrying eggs, the likelihood of a successful spawn increases. Another important factor is the late-summer weather conditions at the mouth of the bay where tiny crab larvae float out into the Atlantic Ocean. Apparently, East Coast storms (Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee) may have helped push those larvae back into the bay.

While TSA officers have been checking identification with black lights and magnifying glasses, the machines are geared to recognize all valid identification, ranging from driver's licenses to tribal IDs and U.S. and foreign passports.
This is the conundrum faced by anyone who writes about what happens on the playing field: How to make it resonate beyond last night's score. Why is it important, what we feel about a particular game or athlete? What is the bigger angle, the bigger connection, the bigger point of view? I think of John Updike, whose 1960 New Yorker piece on Ted Williams' final game, "Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu," frames the dynamic between player and fan as one of nearly mythic significance: "The affair between Boston and Ted Williams," he writes, "… falls into three stages, which may be termed Youth, Maturity, and Age; or Thesis, Antithesis, and Synthesis; or Jason, Achilles, and Nestor." Or Grantland Rice, the legendary sportswriter for whom Grantland is named, a stolid sentimentalist but one who helped create the conventions of the form.
The Clippers stunned the Grizzlies and an entire city by tying the NBA playoff record for the largest deficit overcome at the end of three quarters, when they trailed by 21. Even though Los Angeles lost forward Caron Butler to a broken left hand, the veteran, with his hand wrapped, said the Clippers savored silencing a town with the dramatic and historic comeback.

Visit a dog park: There are several levels here. You can drop by your local dog park (locate them at dogpark.com), find a bench and just watch the critters play. Or you can get more actively involved. Many dog parks are operated and managed by volunteers, said Elliott Silver, who owns DogPark.com, and dog ownership is not usually a requirement to volunteer. Before raising your hand, however, remember that "volunteering" is often synonymous with "scooping poop."
In the meantime, I managed to have some fun recently. Last week, we were invited to the General Motors proving grounds in Milford to honor some of Chevrolets top dealers from around the country.

snagged the opportunity to read it for review before publication, and I am loving it. American history, religious history and family history are all bound up together in ways that would be true in many of our personal stories, except that we rarely recognize the intersections and influences. I look forward to writing about the book after I finish it. There is one passage in the book that's on my mind today, though. In a chapter entitled "The Civil War as a Theological Struggle", Himes discusses the ease with which supporters of slavery were able to make the "biblical" case for their position. As Himes writes, "The abolitionist argument that slavery was contrary to the Bible was much less straightforward."
To put such doubts to rest, Romney told an Ohio television station Monday that he believes "marriage is between a man and a woman, and that's a position I've had for some time and I don't intend to make any adjustments at this point — or ever, by the way."

Filled with fuzzy guitars and sleek electronic textures, Garbage's self-titled 1995 debut offered a kind of techno-conscious counterweight to the prevailing post-grunge sound Vig helped engineer as the producer ofNirvana's landmark "Nevermind." And as frontwoman the Scottish-born Manson projected a dark glamour at odds with the regular-guy image ofPearl Jam's Eddie Vedder.
øAsk about fees and ask to have it all in writing. Credit counselors may not charge any fees or only about $20 for basic advice and education, says the NFCC.

The real questions are in the House. Will the bill be sent to the same committee? Can it find a single Republican vote on that panel? If so, would it make it to the House floor for consideration before the end of the 120-day legislative session in early May? Are there — as supporters claim — as many as 10 Republicans who would support the measure in the House?
"This is mainly a political exercise rather than a serious attempt to deal with our broken immigration system," said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas).
Some of the most memorable moments of last season stemmed from crashes or conflict: An ongoing feud between Kyle Busch and Kevin Harvick led to a pit-road confrontation at Darlington, Brian Vickers was involved in five of seven accidents at Martinsville, the road-course race at Sonoma resembled a demolition derby and featured intentional wrecking between Vickers and Tony Stewart.

The immediate excuse for passing the bill is a pending NLRB case involving the commercial airplane division of the Boeing Co. Early this year, the union that represents Boeing employees in Seattle and Portland, Ore., filed a complaint with the NLRB claiming that Boeing was shifting production of some its 787 Dreamliner airplanes to a factory in South Carolina. The move was retribution, the union alleged, for past lawful strikes in 1977, 1989, 1995, 2005 and 2008.

So, some foods can interfere with how your body uses a medication in the same way that different medications can interact with each other.
The death happened when a possible tornado hit a mobile home park in southwest Missouri, south of Buffalo, said Lt. Dana Eagan of the Dallas County Sheriff's Office. Another 13 people at the trailer park were injured, she said. Crews would begin searching the area once the sun came up, Eagan said.

Recently on "Fashion Police," you had to show your own worst style moment, and yours was wearing denim shorts and imitation Ugg boots. Come on, you don't have something more awful than that?
Moore, who represents the lakefront's 49th Ward, is someone who for most of his career could have been counted upon to cast a skeptical eye on such a proposal. But he was the leadoff cheerleader for the mayor's plan, offering such a detailed rebuttal to the critics you might have thought he was trying to curry favor with someone. "As with any new and untried approach, there are risks and no guarantee of success, but the only thing worse than trying this new approach is to try nothing at all," he said.
The officials said rocks, clubs and firebombs were used in the clashes. Witnesses reported hearing gunshots during the fighting, which lasted several hours.

"If this isn't clear proof of pay to play, then pay to play doesn't exist," said Glenn Byers, Los Angeles County's assistant treasurer, who oversees some school bond sales but doesn't control the hiring of underwriters. "The timing of the payment is irrelevant. You paid, and you got the job. That's pay to play."
My brother went to Penn State and is an administrator at another PA school now. When talk of this first hit the airwaves, he was hell bent on defending Paterno . . . until he read the Grand Jury report. Now he wants Paterno gone yesterday, along with the President. I haven't read the report, and it seems Kareem hasn't either, but apparently it's quite damning regarding the culture set up by JoPa in his Happy Valley autocracy. Everyone there followed JoPa's lead. "If the old man isn't concerned, why should anyone else be, right?", they thought. Well, they thought WRONG! It's just a sad situation.

Consumer advocates have been lobbying against the deal since late last year, arguing that the damage wrought by lenders was far larger than the amount the banks had offered to settle the claims against them. Harris also expressed concern that the banks sought to be relieved of liability for misdeeds that hadn't yet been investigated, and that they faced little penalty for not complying with the deal.

King said most automakers have agreed to confidential talks over those terms, and he is more confident than ever that the UAW will succeed in bringing the union into a plant soon.
A case in point was the concept — nicely combining ambitious design with a sense of rationality about phasing and cost — submitted by a team of the Santa Monica firm Moore Ruble Yudell, the Mexican architect Enrique Norten and the Dutch landscape office West 8. (This was the only team to give a landscape firm a share of top billing.) Its design calls for a new open-air arrival hall for high-speed and other trains covered in a tall canopy of white tree-like forms that would filter sunlight, collect rainwater and — thanks to solar panels along the top — generate electricity.

But a Commerce Department spokesman said officials acted quickly merely because SolarWorld's coalition alleged an import surge in its initial complaint instead of adding the charge later. The ruling doesn't necessarily mean the agency will ultimately find that Beijing illegally subsidizes Chinese exporters, said the spokesman, who asked to be unidentified because he wasn't authorized to speak on the record.

Measure B would require that future members of the five-member board – whether elected or appointed – accept the county's least-generous pension formula: a payout equal to 1.62 percent of salary, multiplied by the number of years worked, payable as soon as age 65. That's a better deal for taxpayers than the current system. Supervisors, who make about $143,000 in salary, now can retire at age 55 and collect a lifetime benefit of 2.7 percent of their salary multiplied by the number of years served on the board, where there is an eight-year term limit.

The unfettered hubris of commercial fishermen, thinking they own everything in the sea, appalls me.
Agreeing to warn drivers against texting on a hand-held phone doesn't mean BMW plans to opt out of the in-car media revolution. Customers are demanding more and more information, Mr. O'Donnell says.

Big - and happy - news is breaking from Bill and Giuliana Rancic.
As the draft ground on, surely a wide receiver would soon be identified and selected. After all, the "coach 'em up" plan had misfired last season as badly as a Ryan Pontbriand snap. Moreover, to paraphrase Gisele Bundchen's remarks after the Super Bowl about Tom Brady, Brandon can't throw it and catch it, too.
As a matter of fact, current WWE Champion CM Punk is no stranger to it, as he himself brought Jeff Hardy's history with drugs and addiction into their feud a few years ago.

Retired Appeals Court Judge Jack Davies said he has lobbied for bringing back a parole board. Instead of everyone serving at least two-thirds of his sentence behind bars, Davies believes offenders should be eligible for parole after serving a third of their time. Using ever-improving risk assessment tools, a board could make the decision about who is an appropriate inmate to bring into the community early, he said.
It was also good practice for her career in law, where she would find herself among the first women breaking into the field.

The new car plant is part of Bulgaria's efforts to attract foreign investment needed to boost its crisis-battered economy, but also part of Asia's rising economic force's search for new export markets.
I admit there are moments when I wouldn't mind living with someone whose talents run counter to mine. A person with enough muscle to pull up entrenched weeds would be welcome as well as one who knows the difference between a ball cock and a flapper tank ball on a toilet. A deeper voice and taller physique would present a more credible appearance to auto mechanics. It would be pleasant to live with someone who would drive me to Powell Hall after dark.

Like a lot of you, I couldn't make it to the Rose Garden to see that mess of a team finish this miserable season. Maybe you were busy watching the Winterhawks or "American Idol." Me?

While I will not comment on contractual arrangements made during the presidential hiring process that pre-dates my term as Board President, it is not uncommon for informal discussions of this nature to take place during the presidential hiring process. Ken Mason plays an important role in helping the University of Iowa President Sally Mason in promoting and raising money for the university. As a spouse, Kens daily schedule, including teaching, is very demanding as he is expected to attend almost every event on campus with President Mason. He attends most, if not all athletic events, including networking, and entertaining donors and alumni at hundreds of other university events throughout the year. Ken is an invaluable partner to President Sally Mason and the university community, helping to raise over $800 million dollars for the university since their arrival in 2007.
The choice of the NBCF as beneficiary of the preview night was an easy one. Oswald’s mother, who lives in California, received a breast cancer diagnosis in July of 2010. “I didn’t want to lose my mom,” Oswald says. “I didn’t want to be an orphan.”

Romney has so far tinkered stylistically with the approach that came up short in the 2008 campaign. He's kept the tailored suits and fancy ties in the closet, while politicking in open-necked shirts and low-rise Levi's slim jeans. He's even sent out, via Twitter, photographic evidence that his perfectly coifed hair sometimes gets mussed.
Along the way, the couple turned Brew Kettle into a thriving business. Now they've turned their eye to the fruit of the vine.

Look in the windows on the corner of Main and Pioneer streets, at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival's "welcome center," and you can see some of Hay's model sets. Granted, these aren't the ones he built as a curious Midwestern kid.

Malkin said about half of PG&E's transmission lines date from before 1970, so the records search would at least be doubled in scope from the current 1,805 miles and would encompass 20,000 segments of pipeline. "That's a lot of individual segments," he said.
As one would expect from a Middle Eastern-oriented menu, kebabs hold a place of honor. A kebab feast for two ($45; extra time required, so you might order ahead) features lamb and chicken, vegetables and cardamom-scented basmati rice.

The phrase "a vintage year" has the connotation of something exceptional and fine. This is because vintage-dating a wine is actually a recent practice. Well into the 20th century, most wines from most places were either sold in bulk from barrel or bottled with no more information than a brand name invented by a bulk bottler. For a wine to display a vintage date was exceptional, in every sense. Today, of course, the great majority of fine wines sport a vintage date.

"This is the only lyric I've written that consists of one long incomplete sentence," Sondheim says. "I wanted it to be like the descriptive caption you might read in a museum next to the painting.

Tip 1: If you're trying to get the most out of your day at Disneyland, I always recommend arriving just before the park opens in the morning, staying until the park closes at night and taking a long break in the heat of the afternoon at your hotel pool or cocktail bar. It may sound like a long day, but you'll get more done in the first two hours and the last two hours of your day than if you spent 15 hours straight at the park.

So maybe the parity will mean that only about 45 percent of April’s division leaders have shelf life. That’s three out of six, so whom do you think is going to last from the Rays, Indians, Rangers, Nationals, Cardinals and Dodgers?

Green garlic and spring onions are the younger versions of their more common surnames, so they're a little milder and sweeter than they will be in a few months.

Plus, they're here for such a short while that it's worth using them whenever possible - to flavor a soup, enhance an omelet or spruce up a salad.
USDA spokesman Aaron Lavallee said the definition of local varies from state to state and region to region depending on the season.

However, a few dishes erred on the sweet side, lacking the mangosteen's intrinsic balance. The thick coconut milk sauce in the beef curry ($7.95) lacks the spiciness described on the menu.

Comment: Underrated. Amassed 40 tackles for loss last two years. Speed and size are not prototypical, but he is reasonably quick, especially with the inside move. Knows how to get to QB.

Ultimately, the real problem isn't impounds but unlicensed drivers. That's why we applaud Beck's comments this week acknowledging that the longer-term solution is to allow undocumented immigrants to obtain provisional or nonresident California driver's licenses.

Once again, (when) this season ends we will have produced seven shows, three cabarets and four educational shows. That's 14 shows in a nine-month period. I feel that we have been able to put the money that we have up on the stage and offer consistent programming that people have seemed to walk away enjoying.

A single state — Massachusetts — successfully imposed a coverage obligation while inducing insurers to stay: In exchange for requiring insurers to cover all individuals, the Commonwealth mandated that those without insurance purchase it. Several factors allowed Massachusetts to accomplish what other states could not: a population that was wealthy, healthy and overwhelmingly insured, plus a fortuitous Medicaid offset that supplemented the cost gap. These factors explain why the Massachusetts exception proves the general rule: States, themselves, cannot avoid the larger separating outcome. Solving this coverage problem demands federal regulation under the Commerce Clause.

Warren Jeffs succeeded his father, Rulon, as head of the polygamist community of Colorado City and the Fundamentalist Church Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. The change was soon followed by investigations of the community and Jeffs by Utah and Arizona officials.

It's grosser than the cheese-stuffed crust pizza we get in this country, though not as gross, I’d argue, as a vegetarian pizza I once got in Britain that was just a crust topped with those canned cubed vegetables.
That feeling was enhanced by the comforting atmosphere of the restaurant. Maybe it's the soothing shade of green tea ice cream on the walls or the gentle cascade of a small fountain in the corner, but sitting in Kiji feels a bit like lounging in the waiting room of a spa. There's a simple elegance, from the soft jazz that filters through the speakers to the subtle shadows cast from low-hanging, red beaded lamps.

Since you are dealing with a mature tree, it's important that water penetrate deeply into the soil surface. The simplest option would be to lay soaker hose in the area and allow it to penetrate deeply into the ground. Another option would be to install deep-root aeration tubes into the soil surface and run a hose or bubbler line into the tube. The purpose of using root aeration tubes is to deliver both water and oxygen to the deeper soil below the tree. One popular design uses PVC plastic pipes with cross-drilled holes that provide the opening into the soil for aeration.

In five games with the Blazers, Hickson is averaging 16.0 points and 5.8 rebounds while shooting 65.5 percent from the field in 26 minutes. This after being buried on the bench in Sacramento, where he averaged 4.7 points in 18.4 minutes. The Kings parted ways with him and Hickson thought he was going to clear waivers and sign a free agent contract with Golden State. But Portland swooped in at the last minute and claimed him, and in 10 short days, he has become the beacon of optimism in an otherwise dismal Blazers season.
Jackson's first proposed legislation to create a "Transformation Alliance" specifically excluded the panel from laws that make records and meetings of public bodies open to the public.

Any gain Gingrich is likely to see from the debate will almost surely come from voters who were considering a Santorum vote. Many of them will be flummoxed by what they saw last night, which played perfectly into Mitt Romney’s effort to paint him as just another Washington insider and big spender.
There is no record of Cook being charged with any such crime, however.
"My fellow Americans, we have traveled through more than a decade under the dark cloud of war," Obama said, standing before armored vehicles. "Yet here, in the predawn darkness of Afghanistan, we can see the light of a new day on the horizon. The Iraq war is over. The number of our troops in harm's way has been cut in half, and more will be coming home soon. We have a clear path to fulfill our mission in Afghanistan, while delivering justice to Al Qaeda."
"What we're talking about in terms of a surrounding neighborhood is a dozen properties surrounded by a state park.

With energy flagging, we made a welcome left turn off the windy East River Park into the East Village at 10th Street. We jogged through tranquil Tompkins Square Park, surrounded by chic speakeasies such as Cienfuegos on East 6th Street.

“When we got more in-depth, I wanted the songs to be perfect so it got frustrating,” she said. “But, looking back, it was the greatest process ever.”
Harris' death has pushed Detroit toward adopting changes much like those other cities have already embraced. The new approach urges firefighters to assess fires before rushing in. If the building cannot be saved and they are certain nobody is inside, they should fight the fire from the exterior to limit their own risk. In Flint, such a change has cut the number of firefighter injuries in abandoned building blazes by a quarter, and reduced injury time by more than a third.

"Given the fact that there was non compliance with the Open Public Meetings Act, the settlement with Sunoco is declared void," said McCaffrey, adding that the public was not supplied with enough details to form an opinion about or comment on the settlement "I do not find this governing body knowingly violated the Open Public Meetings Act."
"Chinese food" and "vegetarian" don't often appear in the same sentence, and for good historical reason. Meat has long been a luxury for the Chinese, who are familiar with poverty and famine; having the means to put poultry, fish, pork or beef on the table is a point of pride. (Witness the traditional 12-course Chinese wedding banquet, which starts with a whole roasted suckling pig and proceeds from there through various manifestations of animal protein.) At the same time, the Chinese have plenty of dishes in which meat is more the condiment than the course. So it's not a stretch to create an entirely vegetarian Chinese menu, and that's what Green Wok has done.
Some movies deserve an honorable mention:
As the agency continued to work on a written response to Grassley, an email to Hoover proposed a "watered-down" account of what was found at the site of the Terry killing. As an aside, the email added that Grassley was "at best imposing an unobtainable standard on ATF."

The leading Republicans and Democrats who have been working on a separate cyber-security bill in the Senate issued a statement criticizing the House bill because it doesn't propose standards for protecting crucial infrastructure, such as power grids and water systems. Those systems are vulnerable to cyber-attack, and there is nothing requiring their owners to shore up computer defenses.
At least three suicide attackers struck a heavily guarded housing complex for international workers in Kabul and the Taliban declared the start of a spring offensive, a dark bookend to Obama's brief overnight visit that contrasted starkly with his assertion that the conflict is winding down.

And Noah Webster declared in 1787: "Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops."

What sets Gialina pizza apart is the handmade crust, with puffy edges that are darkened but not blistered and a delicately chewy texture - it's nearly cracker-crisp on the outside, giving way to that elusive tender breadiness. The secret, according to Ardiana, is a low yeast-to-flour ratio and a dough that is wetter than most. She also makes the dough the night before so it has time to proof.
Federal records show that 20 people, most of them in vehicles, have been killed in accidents at street crossings with Metrolink trains since 1999. That is higher than other similar commuter rail agencies, except Metra, which had 22 such deaths.

He was just getting started. Przybilla added two emphatic blocks, one on Udonis Haslem and another on Joel Anthony, to round out a solid first shift that lasted six minutes. He would have an equally solid second half and finshed with four points, six rebounds, two blocks and one assist. He dove to the ground for loose balls and at one point administered a hard foul on James during a drive to the basket.

Meanwhile, the Blazers' starting center had a different sort of cloudy night. Camby played just 3:18 in the second half, never leaving his perch on the Blazers' bench in the fourth quarter. If it seems odd that the Blazers' best rebounder and shot blocker would sit so long when the Blazers were desperate for any kind of rebounding and defensive help, you would not be alone.

If you're planning to drive around the island, don't miss Pah Ke's in suburban Kaneohe. It's in an aging strip mall. The restaurant itself looks much like any local Chinese cookery. But Pah Ke's modest surroundings can't hide the creativity of chef Raymond Siu. Siu specializes in Chinese-Hawaiian regional cuisine, using as many local ingredients as possible. Pah Ke has an extensive menu -- 148 items -- but that doesn't stop Siu. Tell him the kinds of things you like, and he'll whip up something special for you.
The latest poll of the bunch, from NBC News and the Wall Street Journal, puts Obama ahead, 49% to 43%. A composite of recent polls from Real Clear Politics gives Obama, on average, a nearly 3-point lead.
Just save room for dessert at Peclard, a glorious combination of coffee shop, patisserie and wine bar with vaulted ceilings, painted murals and red velvet upholstery parceled out over four levels. Or try the chocolate truffles and Luxemburgerlis (colorful mini-macaroons) at Confiserie Sprungli, which also offers a chance to cool your steaming feet (and your smoking credit card) after a shopping spree on the Bahnhofstrasse, a high-end retail thoroughfare flanked by heavy hitters such as Hermes, Cartier, Louis Vuitton and Prada.

McCarthy, who also is a North Ridgeville school board member, urged the community to visit the shop and make a purchase to show their support. Others repeated the request.
The musical plays out like an episode of VH1's "Behind the Music," chronicling the members' roots in New York's folk-music scene, their bonding over booze and LSD in the Virgin Islands, their rapid rise to fame and the love quadrangle and in-fighting that assured their success would be short-lived. This is all familiar territory, although it is not without its voyeuristic appeal, as when songwriter John Phillips discovers his wife, Michelle, has been sleeping with Denny. He can handle a little infidelity, he says, but he refuses to let his woman get between him and "my tenor."
While visiting Sargento's website, Mr. Tidbit was astonished to find that this brings to 36 (36!) the number of Sargento sliced cheese products.

Off to the east, Cantrell pointed to a couple of hens sneaking through the woods, followed by a large gobbler. Every so often, the big tom would fan his tail, showing off for the hens. He never gobbled, but his presence put an end to the gobbling from the bird Cantrell had been talking to for so long. That bird flew down and wandered off, rather than challenge the big boy.
Meanwhile, the Yankees picked up Curtis Granderson, who, in an off-year, hit 24 home runs. And with Nick Swisher hitting 29 home runs, no one was missing Melky.
Last fall, a federal judge dismissed several claims by shareholders. Even though Mr. Mudd had made statements in 2007 noting that Fannie Mae wasn't heavily exposed to subprime loans, U.S. District Judge Paul Crotty threw out many of the investors' claims on grounds that the firm's public filings "contained cautionary language that warned investors" about increased mortgage risks.

øI would not expect Shanahan to leave the league office any time soon, not with collective-bargaining negotiations upcoming. He will want to see his player safety department fully developed before he leaves. But he's a player in his heart, and he undoubtedly misses wins and losses.

If Oakwood Commons succeeds -- and presumably First Interstate would not invest $45 million without serious commitments from retailers -- it will pump money into the Cleveland Heights-University Heights School District and South Euclid's coffers.

Finally some of the cheese is blended with flavorings such as herbs, garlic, pepper, apricot preserves and honey to make eight flavors in addition to the plain.
But, above all, "My Faraway One" is a love story, told by artists who inspired and energized each other — and whose differences in age and temperament could seem insurmountable. In a letter written in 1917, Stieglitz asked O'Keeffe if she wanted to have his child. She responded affirmatively, but nearly a year later he wrote that any child they had "would be drowned to death" along with its parents because he didn't "know how to be part of the big game."

Ironically, this speaks to the complaint of those who feel Obamacare did not go far enough -- that it should have extended a Medicare-type "single-payer" plan to the whole populace instead of throwing a public program atop the hugely expensive for-profit insurance system we're stuck with now.

I am one of the first liberals to admit I voted for Proposition C because I have seen my private insurance rates go up twice in the past year so don't give me this baloney that if everybody buys health insurance our rates will go down. If anyone has seen Frontline they will know that the Obama Administration cut a deal with the insurance industry because Rahmbo was too chicken to go against the insurance lobby. I also feel bad for working class people who can barely afford to get buy right now so now they got another bill, thanks Obama. I would have preferred that we go to the public option since it will keep the insurance companies honest and maybe take the health care costs away from businesses (large and small) so we can be competitive in this global economy since other countries in the world provide coverage for their people. I'm sure if your some narrow minded conservative you probably are going to say that this going to raise our taxes but isn't increase health care costs another form of increasing taxes.

Limahuli's signature plant is the alula (Brighamia insignis), a lobelia relative that could have been a Dr. Seuss invention; it's been described as "a cabbage on top of a bowling pin." The alula's natural habitat is the precipitous Na Pali cliffs, where only a few individuals remain. No one has ever seen its pollinator in action; some speculate that it may be the elusive green sphinx moth, or something even more rare, if not extinct. Botanical garden botanists have rappelled down the vertical cliffs to hand-pollinate alula plants in situ. Alula has been successfully propagated by Martin Grantham at San Francisco State University, among others - but is hard to keep alive. An attempted introduction at Kilauea Point is looking unsuccessful. It really misses its cliffs, where it's being displaced by the likes of invasive sanseveria, the familiar houseplant "mother-in-law's tongue."

A slow shutter implied the motion of the surf, while a graduated filter balanced the bright sky with the foreground.

"There's risks in every player that you look at, but you weigh that. We checked out everybody that we brought in. We all felt comfortable with that." … The Bears have 72 players on the roster and can carry 90. They will add more than 10 undrafted college free agents and don't be surprised if they still poke around in secondary free agency, possibly looking at defensive tackles.
What a mess! We have to, as a beginning, get special-interest money out of politics and demand that the Supreme Court either assume an apolitical stance or stand for re-election like the rest of our lawmakers.

The memorabilia sale scandal of Big Ten championship rings and game-day gear by players at Ohio State for money and discount tattoos, and even its cover-up, amounted to comparatively small potatoes. But if the Buckeyes did not measure up then, who's to say, with a hearty embrace of their raffish side, they might not set the standard in the future?
Deitz’s musical style isn’t terribly idiosyncratic, but it certainly is personal. He’s developed two unmistakable sonic signatures: his broad, warm baritone and his deft guitar playing, which often sounds like several guitarists playing at once.

Purchasing. To estimate how much wallpaper you'll need, multiply the space's width by its height, then divide by 50 (a standard roll covers about 56 square feet). The result, rounded up, is the number of rolls you'll need. Because rolls vary so much in price, from $30 to more than $200, it's difficult to estimate the cost of a whole room. It can range from $600 to $1,200. While prices are quoted in terms of single rolls, they're usually sold in double rolls (which are double the price). To complicate things more, commercial paper is often priced by the yard.

Cheating with another woman, however, isn't the only way to be a bad husband during a breast cancer ordeal.

GOP PRESIDENTIAL RACE: Mitt Romney added to his big lead in the race for convention delegates by winning Republican presidential primaries in North Carolina, Indiana and West Virginia. The former Massachusetts governor won at least 63 delegates, with 28 delegates in West Virginia still undecided. He has a commanding lead in the race for delegates with 919, just 225 delegates shy of the 1,144 he needs to clinch the GOP nomination — a gap he could close by the end of the month.

A turkey breast brines quickly and is easy to handle. We adjusted measurements for the brine from our Best Way Brined Turkey recipe, which results in tender, moist meat and crispy skin. Throw leftovers in a sandwich with garlic aioli, cranberry-onion relish, avocado, and bacon, and you'll be one happy turkey.

Camp Curry: Founded in 1899 by Indiana schoolteachers David and Jenny Curry, Camp Curry's original concept was to provide affordable room and board for weary travelers. True to that vision, Camp Curry still offers no-frills accommodations in canvas tents trimmed by green wood. The tent cabins are a bit drafty but provide a good, low-cost way to stay in the park. Tent cabins lack private bathrooms; some have heaters for late fall. The usual layout is simple: two beds, a nightstand and a lamp. Located next to the front porch is a bear-safe locker for your food. During the 1920s, the camp offered music, dancing and entertainment; today, the amphitheater is mostly used for ranger talks and some light entertainment. There's a food court with a diverse menu that offers Mexican food, pizza, burgers and hot dogs and a cafeteria nearby. Contact: (801) 559-4884, www.yosemitepark.com/Accommodations.aspx

That's when Sunderland first told her parents she was going to sail around the world.

Rapidly aging Japan has one of the worst demographic profiles, and most European profiles are famously grim. In China, long-term economic growth could face serious demographic restraints. The number of Chinese senior citizens is soaring by 3.7 percent year after year. By 2030, as Eberstadt notes, there will be many more older workers (ages 50-64) than younger workers (15-29).

Mr. Romney's record in the public and private sectors has been one of putting pragmatism over ideology. Despite his recent insistence that he is "severely" conservative, he has shown a willingness and ability to be a problem-solver first and foremost, someone able to work with those of divergent political views to achieve common goals.

What does a different response in "cortical control areas" mean? At this point, said Purnell in a phone interview, it means nothing more than that the two substances did prompt different responses in the brain--that the brain did not respond to them identically. Within some of the "cortical control areas" where differences were seen, lie some important neural real estate, including regions where notions of reward and addiction are processed. As scientists have a closer look in future studies, they should be able to zero in on which specific areas are affected differently by the two forms of sugar, he said.

If it's any conversation that doesn't include her, then the problem probably isn't that she's not getting enough attention but rather that she's got work to do in the patience and listening departments. This is not unusual, of course, because kids often have a hard time imagining life from others' perspectives, so gentle but firm counsel about waiting your turn (like you have to do in school, without the raising-hands part) is appropriate. And then when her 4-year-old sister starts interrupting her, you can point out in a not-too-told-ya-so kind of way that now she knows how it feels.
Preston said he was pleasantly surprised when 83 artifacts were unearthed at the site on the first day alone. “We collected biface projectile points, scrapers, and flakes of rhyolite, quartz, quartzite and chert from the surface, and hundreds more were observable to the naked eye with more probably hiding under a thin layer of silt,” Preston recalls.

What the (bleep) is wrong with people these days?
As one might guess, most homosexuality "separations," as they are called in the Air Force, occurred in the first few weeks of basic training, before the more costly technical training began. And many of these removals would have occurred in any case, since they were the result of unacceptable conduct and not just a declaration of sexual orientation. In any case, it would have made no material difference in Air Force training costs if we had retained all 3,000 people.

"They are mad for classicism," Kenny says of the day’s fine furniture buyers. "The whole emphasis is on classical antiquity."

In the subway ad campaign, riders are importuned to sign an online petition and go to a website for more information, which of course I did, since I always follow orders from billboards. Even on the website, information is scarce. But there is a new poll result: 97% of Americans find paper bills more convenient than metal coins. This, if true, is an astonishing figure — not only because it reflects near-unanimity, but because I find it hard to develop any opinion at all about the relative convenience of paper money versus coinage. (And opinions are how I make my living.) I would say "It all depends," which is a choice pollsters never give you.

Romney is unlikely to go for that. At the same time, Paul’s backers recognize that selling supporters on an alliance with Romney carries special risks, since Paul’s bond with his backers is predicted on his record of principled stands. A pact would have to be done “very cautiously,” says Benton. “We wouldn’t ask our people to do that if we worried they were just being coopted or that we were in some way selling out.”

Only 79 police officer positions are being eliminated outright, but because of Civil Service bumping rules, the 29 captains, lieutenants and sergeants being demoted one rank will trickle down the ladder, and result in an equal number of officers going out the door. Kevin Starkey is one of those officers, the couple found out late Tuesday. But both consistently took the focus away from themselves and back to their fellow officers, along with the city residents they say will suffer from less police presence.
With filthy spreadsheet in hand, I developed a set of specific categories based on majority results of what people were looking for (and who was seeking the activity) and added categories as I went along. For instance, the numbers told me that in any given "anal" search, the numbers revealed that Men Seeking Women was the majority default for results, and Men Seeking Men was the lesser variable. So either the gay-anal assumptions for "Sodom by the Bay" were wrong (likely), or the gays prefer to use other online hookup services and local community resources for anonymous anal sex.

Dissent simmers in the Crowder gang’s ranks, and the juicy possibility exists that Crowder and Quarles will soon be crossing paths. Boyd did say he wanted to get into “protection, pills, robbin’ and gamblin’ “ and didn’t want to work with outsiders the way his father did. Let’s see: Bo Crowder died at the end of the first season. Quarles is an outsider working with the Dixie Mafia and their local rep, Duffy. Limehouse doesn’t like outsiders, either. Bring 'em on!
"I just moved here to retire," Aza Samchuck told me one afternoon as he sat astride a bicycle and watched teenagers leap from a piling into the chilly water. He is 35, Samchuck said, but because he's done well in his profession, he can arrange a few lucrative days of out-of-town work per month, then hang loose in Nelson the rest of the time. Of course, I had to ask his profession.

Of the debate over the expiring Bush tax cuts, Obama said, "I believe we ought to make the tax cuts for the middle class permanent. These families are the ones who saw their wages and incomes flatline over the last decade -- and they deserve a break.

I'll tell you where NOT to hang out at House of Blues: under the balcony on the main floor. The overhang usually wreaks havoc on the sound, compounded by the noise from the nearby bar stations. You'll fare better upstairs. No need to spring for reserved seats, which will set you back a few bucks more. Standing in the balcony gives you a nice view of the stage, plus an infinitely better aural experience. -- John Soeder, Plain Dealer Pop Music Critic
It's true. In the restaurant world, there's little rest for the weary. It's go go go, a feeling that home cooks certainly experience during the holiday season when entertaining family and friends becomes more frequent and fancy.
"His knowledge is there. His experience is getting there. He's got what it takes," said Sorensen, a U.S. sliding coach who mentors athletes from smaller nations. "His passion and dedication to the sport oozes out of him. He just wants to go fast."
-- Cisco Systems received two shareholder proposals at its annual meeting in November. One sought to tie options vesting to performance goals, while the other asked the company to examine -- and consider limiting -- the pay gap between its highest and lowest-paid employees. Both failed, but the AFL-CIO said it plans to submit another pay-for-performance proposal for Cisco's annual meeting in November.
Cleveland Clinic cardiologist Stanley Hazen, whose research last year uncovered a link between heart disease and an individual's intestinal flora -- the bacteria that aid in digestion of food -- has entered into a licensing agreement with a diagnostic company to develop the test.
"People who get their carry-on stolen usually board late," said Kevin Coffey, a police detective and travel-security consultant in Los Angeles. "They're sitting in Row 44, their bag is above Row 19, and when the plane lands, a crook grabs the bag and he's gone."
As you may recall, President Obama came into office a very inexperienced politician, spouting a lot of hopeful and idealistic rhetoric. He had made a name for himself by refusing to demonize conservatives and Republicans.
Horse racing genealogy is generally about breeding, but human family ties linked some owners and winners. Stephanie's Kitten, named for the granddaughter of owner Ken Ramsey, overtook Stopshoppingmaria, named for owner Mike Repole's wife's purchasing habits, to capture the $1 million Juvenile Fillies Turf race for 2-year-olds over a mile.
Did the Sharks make it tough against St. Louis? No, they did not.

According to news reports, more than 14,000 New York City tykes took the gifted-kindergarten entrance exam this winter, and almost 5,000 made the cut. In some neighborhoods, nearly all the children scored above average, making entire blocks look like the metropolitan version of Lake Wobegon.
So at last we reach the saga of Pujols, or "Albert" as my kids always call him. Isn't it time that we admit we wanted him to be more than a ball player, and that our own (greedy?) desire to have him make us feel special is part of why we're so hurt by his departure? My daughters love Albert, have loved watching him play, and I hope with all my heart that their summer evenings at the ballpark with their dad and me become some of their most treasured childhood memories.
The remembrance ceremony was the final event following six waves of Marine that have returned from Afghanistan since early March. In all more than 1,100 Marines served in what Lt. Col. William Vivian called some of the hottest spots in Afghanistan.

FINRA says a more reasonable charge is between 1 percent and 5 percent.
"Land out there, particularly in 15-acre parcels located so close to city services, is getting pretty scarce," she said. "The city's being able to lock this up now should prove to be a great benefit in years to come."

Following an intriguing first act in which health-challenged 19-year-old Hannah (Rachel Hendrix) learns that she was actually adopted (after surviving a failed late-term abortion), Jon Erwin and Theresa Preston's script stumbles with lame attempts at humor and "hipness" as Hannah sets off on a road trip with friends — in an unreliable old VW bus, no less — to track down her biological mom.
(An FYI here: My round-trip ticket to Venice, Italy/ returning from Florence in March of this year was $680, inclusive of all taxes and fees -- or about $350 less than the 2013 winter season.)
Both "Pan Am" and "The Playboy Club" have been lumped into the category of "Mad Men" wannabes/copycats, since that Emmy Award-winning AMC series about advertising men and women specializes in reflecting on its early '60s setting. While NBC's "The Playboy Club" got off to a completely superficial start -- false eyelashes and bouffant hairdos alone do not compelling drama make -- ABC's "Pan Am" (10 p.m., Sunday, KATU), deliberate positioning of vintage magazine covers in the camera frame, the reminder that stewardesses had to wear girdles on the job -- it's all handled with a knowing touch, without taking itself too seriously.
Yet even this single step toward reform faces fierce opposition from both the left and right ends of the political spectrum. It looks unlikely to pass Congress, and that's too bad.
“The Dodgers have been in turmoil on and off the field under McCourt's ownership. Yet, Magic Johnson said the new owners ‘intend to build on the fantastic foundation laid by Frank McCourt.’

(OK, some of you don’t know — you don’t follow chess and you don’t think it’s a sport. Well, friends, at a minimum, it’s “mental sport.” And, as far as I’m concerned, Bobby Fischer was every bit the athlete that Michael Jordan was — both were hypercompetitive and ruthless in their pursuits, plus Fischer was a better trash talker.)
Utilities successfully argued for a measure allowing them to comply with the mandate by financing renewable energy projects outside the region. They could purchase renewable energy certificates, or RECs - pieces of paper that each represent 100 kilowatt-hours of renewable energy. Purchasing RECs from, say, a Texas wind farm, would probably mean lower cost for Missouri consumers than if a utility built its own wind farm here. But it would mean one less energy project would get built in Missouri, which therefore wouldn't benefit from any associated jobs.
"The project was about women working in water education and conservation," she said of the program, which trains women in implementing water and sanitation programs in their villages. "For me, this was particularly interesting as SRP started by bringing water to the Valley."
In fact, these days, unless you're a player, coach or approved visitor, admission will be denied. Men acting as bouncers will, in fact, bounce anyone who tries to enter. Couple that with Kelly's new edict not to disclose injury information and this season the Ducks have become the most guarded team in the Pacific-12 Conference.
He won't get to stand on the stage at the Clark Sports Center and make his speech. He won't get to hear the cheers from the Cubs fans who always flood the tiny town when anyone who once wore a C on their caps gets honored by the Hall. He won't get to see his plaque hanging in the gallery.

The current Buckeyes deserve comparison with the Greg Oden-Mike Conley 2007 team, which finished second in the NCAA Tournament. That was the best Ohio State team since the Jerry Lucas-John Havlicek three-year monster of 1960-62.
He recalled what happened to the package of four "Reform Ohio Now" constitutional amendments that a coalition of Democrats, unions and academics placed on the fall 2005 ballot. The amendments would have allowed early absentee voting, lowered campaign contribution limits, changed the system for redrawing congressional and legislative districts and shifted oversight of statewide elections from the secretary of state to a nine-member panel.
Walden said he was trying to “just forget about” Allen's home run and “get ready for the next game,” while acknowledging that was easier said than done. He said he did look at video of Allen's home run.

There is a long tradition of open records in our country and our state. Yet, we find ourselves spending more and more time in court and negotiation to get information that unquestionably should be public. At The Oregonian, we have sued and been sued as we try to pry loose information we believe is in the public interest. And our company has been willing to spend sometimes large amounts of money on legal costs to shine light on these cases.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said wholesale prices, which measure price changes before they reach the consumer, rose 0.4 percent in August after rising
The 335i I tested rates an excellent EPA combined city/highway fuel economy rating of 23 m.p.g. Only the C250 Sport can match that, but the Mercedes only comes with an automatic transmission, and a 335i with BMW's 8-speed automatic trounces it by 3 m.p.g.
A loss to Chivas at home would transform those previously planted doubts into a full fledge garden of emotional turmoil. And with a road game at Los Angeles before a home game against currently undefeated Kansas City in the next two weeks, that losing streak could easily stretch to five.
During the winter, crabbing dominates the docks, with a steady stream of boats loading pots or unloading their catch. A nearby University of California at Davis marine research center is open to the public at scheduled times and offers information about the coast and its aquatic life.
While Duke slipped back with a bogey at the eighth and a double-bogey at the ninth, Els found himself in a two-way tie at the top after Dufner bogeyed the par-four sixth.
The owners are more out of touch with fans than ever. Players, too. Basically, the game is tone deaf to what's going on around it, and I'm not sure fans are going to forgive the NBA in the way they forgave past work stoppages in the NFL and Major League Baseball.
Francis Howell senior Abby Hempen captured her second successive gold medal in the 100 breast.

Other major "pillars" in the policy package include:
The book is powerfully illustrated, beginning with the assassination and ending with the death, in 1926, of Robert Todd Lincoln, the president's surviving son. To leaf through its pages is to walk through the life of the nation after that night at Ford's Theater in 1865, watching as a man became a legend. To remember Lincoln, the Kunhardts demonstrate, is to remember ourselves -- for better and occasionally for worse. (The lone speech by a black man at the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial, we learn from "Looking for Lincoln," went largely unreported.)
Pamela Stacy, who heads the project for the consultants, Dover, Kohl & Partners, of Coral Gables, Fla., said, "We know we want to create a village center instead of a large single use building" like the mall.

Miller's face was already bloodied by the time the New Jersey crowd started a "Let's go Miller!" chant to rally the hometown fighter. The season five winner of "The Ultimate Fighter" taunted Miller moments before he rolled him over and locked in his submission hold in the finale of the four-bout prime-time card held by the world's top MMA circuit in front of 10,788 fans. UFC announced a $1.1 million gate.
As for immigration policy, it was difficult to discern their differences.
Some on the Blue Ribbon Commission naively suggested that the new tax increases may not be passed on to the consumer by the gas station dealers and their suppliers. Well I can tell you that after having worked in the oil industry for over 40 years, the tax increase will be passed directly to consumers. These dealers are small businesses with very small operating margins and they cannot afford to absorb an increase in the excise tax. The same applies to small delivery and trucking businesses and families in regard to the proposed increased cost of inspections and registration fees.
Morrow County economic officials lobbied the state Legislature during its last session to modify the Oregon Investment Advantage tax-incentive program to make the prospective project at the Port of Morrow eligible. The Investment Advantage program can exempt companies new to the state from Oregon income taxes for as long as a decade.
Kevin Pelton: For a guy who spent most of the year in the D-League, Johnson sure looked comfortable on the floor during the playoffs. His lack of strength limits Johnson's ability to contribute regularly, but for a third center, you could do a lot worse. (The Blazers certainly did during the season's first four months.) He's got a spot on the roster.
"As a young linebacker, Junior was my hero growing up, and once I had the opportunity to meet him I saw that he was everything I hoped he would be and more," former Dolphins linebacker and teammate Zach Thomas said.

Council spokesman Abdul-Sattar Bayrkdar said the trial will focus on three charges out of 150 cases in which Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi has been linked to death squads against Shiites and government officials.
I disagree with his position. We cannot afford to be unrealistic about who or what we are looking at to protect our American freedoms. That's how we end up with Transportation Security Administration agents frisking children and grandmas without any suspicion that they might be doing something wrong. We don't have enough police or the time to screen every member the public.
None of that fazed Southwest Portland resident Jean Pierson, who read about her in The Oregonian’s “Pet of the Week” section in December.

Tuesday's vote was 52-45 in favor of starting debate on the Democratic legislation  eight votes shy of the 60 needed.

Tonight’s result came as no surprise to either side of the debate in Upper Freehold. The vote also creates yet one more hurdle in the state’s efforts to get the medical marijuana program going almost two years after it was signed into law.
She recognizes, for instance, that her lyrical approach has to be different.
You need to try the house-made charcuterie with boar, Nostrano and Genovese salami cured on premises. These also go well with the tricolore salad with bitter greens, apple, walnuts, salty Gorgonzola and honey vinaigrette.
Not everything works, but the effort is admirable. A Little Gem wedge ($11), for example, was made with pristine lettuce, pickled shallots, tiny whole radishes and frilly tops, but the creamy onion vinaigrette was so sweet it compromised the flavor of the other ingredients.
The CBI is a third-tier tournament in its fourth year. After the NCAA Tournament (68 teams) and NIT (32) snatch 100 teams, the CBI puts together its 16 best. A fourth tournament, the CIT, includes only mid-majors.

"This is beyond my wildest dreams," Nobles said. "People have finally learned that our natural environment is as important to us as economic development, if not more so."
Christie said the session should also examine controversial bills on school choice and affordable housing but focus on property taxes. He has proposed a 33-bill "tool kit" for towns and school districts and a 2.5 percent limit on yearly property tax hikes, which could only be exceeded for debt payments or if 60 percent of local voters override it.

SANFORD, Fla. — The Trayvon Martin shooting case took a bizarre turn today when George Zimmerman’s attorneys said they were dropping the neighborhood watch captain as a client, complaining that they have lost all contact with him and that he called the prosecutor and talked to a TV host after they told him not to speak to anyone.

Behind wide double doors, a big bathroom beckoned with a marble-framed sink, oversized shower and Essential Elements bath products. Although I usually welcome uncarpeted, nonallergenic floors, when I dropped an earring on the bathroom tile, I felt dirt.

The Woods study appeared online, accompanied by a university press release, barely two weeks after Mr. Woods stepped away from the links. It isn't unusual for universities to trumpet studies before they undergo peer review, but this one made some rushed shots into the rough, researchers said.
Pritchard got too powerful for the liking of those running the team in Portland and at Allen's Vulcan Inc. mothership. He got too much attention. He got too much adoration. Too many people heard "Pritch-Slapped!" and "In KP We Trust" too many times. And even though he had a shaky free-agent summer in 2009, given that Pritchard's deep roster saved the 2009-2010 season from being derailed by injuries, he should not be left to doubt his job security.

Sometimes a mom's cooking - for better or worse - is the reason a person becomes a chef. Bissonnette realized early that if he wanted to eat well, he'd have to cook for himself, he says, and he credits his mom "a thousand percent" with inspiring him, however dubiously, to his profession. In contrast, Jacqueline Winch, mom to "Ace of Cakes" Duff Goldman, was a skilled and adventurous cook, her son says, and her beef fondue is the dish that made him a chef.

For those of us who value social and cultural diversity in schools, these misleading "grades" have had a devastating impact.

We have no beef with the non-profit status of credit unions that are serving the role intended by Congress. However, the more a credit union changes its balance sheet to operate more like a bank, it should convert to a bank charter and assume all of the responsibilities that come with being a bank. That includes complying with greater regulatory scrutiny, giving back to their communities through the Community Reinvestment Act and paying income taxes.
The hiring of Meyer, a two-time national championship coach at age 47, would be among the most significant hires in recent college football history. It's not often coaches with his resume come back on the market, at least not without an unsuccessful stop in the NFL to take some shine off their accomplishments. In the past 40 years, nine coaches have won national titles at one school and later coached at another. Only fifth-year Alabama coach Nick Saban, who won a title with LSU before going to the NFL's Miami Dolphins, would match Meyer's star quality in the modern era. Saban won another title in his third season with the Crimson Tide.

When the music business was changed dramatically by the switch from large, bulky LPs to small, easy-to-store CDs, Musical Offering suddenly had extra space. So the music store was confined to the back half of the deep room, and the front became a full-service cafe, featuring small square wooden tables with marble-look tops, that seated about 50. The menu was expanded to soups, salads, sandwiches and a few hot dishes, prepared in a kitchen at the rear of the store.

Dialogue has in fact already begun. At least two rounds of talks have taken place this year, in Qatar and Germany, between U.S. officials and Syed Tayyab Agha, one of Mullah Omar's closest lieutenants: almost certainly the first high level contact between the two sides since 2001.

But they represent an important start, and a useful platform to build upon.

Last season: Cowboys lost four of last five games and missed playoffs in coach Jason Garrett's first full season. They lost at eventual Super Bowl champion Giants in regular-season finale for NFC East title and conference's last playoff spot. New defensive coordinator Rob Ryan installed scheme without benefit of offseason workouts. While Dallas gave up 347 points after allowing franchise-worst 436 before he got there, there were too many blown fourth-quarter leads.

Centrowitz said the race in Paris, his first on that kind of stage, was "more nerve-wracking than any race I've been in, in a long, long time. It didn't really hit until we put our stuff in the basket and started doing last-minute strides. I was looking around and seeing all of these really fast guys. For a split-second I just didn't think I was ready for it. I had to wake up and realize I was racing just another race and relax a little bit."

Carrington painted and wrote energetically in Mexico, inspired by the country's rich pre-Hispanic civilizations and the mythologies and occult knowledge of cultures from around the world. One of her best-known works is an enormous mural titled "The Magical World of the Maya," commissioned in the early 1960s for the National Museum of Anthropology. Her most famous written work, a 1974 fantastical novel titled "The Hearing Trumpet," includes an account of a feminist uprising in a women's retirement home.

The Middletown City Council recently tabled a resolution asking the Ohio General Assembly to revise the state's collective bargaining law.
In the end, every country got half of what it wanted. Yet it is clear all three leaders will need to compromise if the euro zone is to escape its death spiral. Ms. Merkel will eventually have to recognize that fiscal transfers and the underwriting of government debt markets is essential to restore the confidence of markets; Mr. Sarkozy must accept that further transfers of sovereignty to supra-national authorities are essential to address the moral hazard implicit in a full fiscal union; and Mr. Cameron must acknowledge that only a fiscal and political union built around the existing EU institutions can create conditions for a lasting solution to the euro crisis in the timescale needed. Is there scope for such a grand compromise? On the evidence of last week, probably not.

2010 Y. Rousseau Old Vines Russian River Valley Colombard ($17, 13.2%): It almost seems foolhardy to recommend a lowly workhorse like French Colombard at this price (see sfg.ly/l2643y for more), but Yannick Rousseau makes that case. Napa-based Rousseau wanted a wine to honor his native Gascony, and found 35-year-old vines to make his point. Full of mandarin peel and ripe fruit, with fern and honey accents. Edgy enough to take on oysters, ripe enough for Brentwood corn.
"Palmer Hoyt realized the sports world was changing," Mauk said. "The so-called recreation sports were becoming more and more popular. He asked me to join the sports department in 1964, but I turned it down three times. I agreed to try it as an experiment in the last half of 1965 and made the decision early in 1966 to go full time."

Some fellow critics lashed back. The Los Angeles Times' Christopher Knight, in a lengthy 1991 critique, called Kramer "the Little Dutch Boy of art criticism," whose writings were futile efforts to hold back the tide of "Pop artists, Minimalists, Conceptualists and other horrid children of the 1960s." A few years later, critic Peter Plagens wrote in Newsweek that Kramer was the critic the art world reads "like crazy, even if it's by flashlight, under the blankets."

Another reason the Broncos might not get in a serious bidding war would be Tim Tebow. By wobble or by will, Tebow took the worst team in the NFL — that's what their 7-24 record dating to Nov. 1, 2009, made the Broncos — and helped lead them to the playoffs and a first-round upset of the Pittsburgh Steelers last season.

The Translational Portfolio is a fascinating look into the future and what a new era in medicine might look like someday. It uses technologies that are just a few years old, like the ability to map a patient's DNA and target specific genes, or to take an adult cell back to its formative state and reprogram it to avoid a previous malfunction.

"It's not just about strengthening alliances or promoting democratic values or projecting American leadership around the world, although it does all those things and it will make us safer and more secure," he said. "It's also about the biblical call to care for the least of these, for the poor, for those at the margins of our society; to answer the responsibility we're given in Proverbs to speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute."

"It's so important to be trained in CPR and to have access to an AED machine. Look around, you might be surprised by the number of AED machines you see," Joly said. She stressed that using an AED machine to 'shock" someone's heart is not as intimidating as it seems.
On the role of the poet, she has written, "We may feel bitterly how little our poems can do in the face of seemingly out-of-control technological power and seemingly limitless corporate greed, yet it has always been true that poetry can break isolation, show us to ourselves when we are outlawed or made invisible, remind us of beauty where no beauty seems possible, remind us of kinship where all is represented as separation."

The YWCA did not want the old Locust site and its history to be forgotten. It had provided five decades of community support to girls and women and well as housing, primarily for rural women who moved to the city for work. The wives and girlfriends of soldiers stationed at Jefferson Barracks and Fort Leonard Wood stayed there. And the housing also served entertainers such as Butterfly McQueen, an actress best known for her role in "Gone With the Wind." She was in town performing at the Muny but could not stay in a hotel with her white co-stars.
The proposal earned withering scorn from Dayton even before the GOP unveiled it. The Democratic governor called a news conference to blast Republican leaders after hearing third-hand of what he called "secret meetings" with the Vikings.

Though Phoenix outshot Nashville through the first two periods, Rinne wasn't tested much. He had a shot go off the post in the first period and saw heavier traffic in the crease as the Coyotes shook off a sluggish start. But he never faltered after giving up five goals in Sunday's 5-3 Game 2 loss — the Predators' worst performance of the postseason — snapping Phoenix's team-record streak of three consecutive road playoff wins and a run of three straight wins in Nashville overall snapped. The Coyotes had given up just four goals on the road in the playoffs before Wednesday.

"Unfortunately, when they built the freeway they didn't do any kind of structural analysis to see what would happen," he said. "As a result, we're not able to prove there's been structural damage, but we believe there has been.

On her two prior solo albums, Annie “St. Vincent” Clark made it clear that she’s got a taste for Kate Bush-like sonic experimentation — and that she allows herself a certain inattention to melody. “Strange Mercy” transcends the limitations of the first two, not by offering a clutch of catchy tunes (though she could probably do that if she wanted to), but by overwhelming the listener with some of the most wigged-out soundscapes on a pop record in recent memory. Parts of the CD sound like Yes — particularly the synthesizer freakout that caps “Surgeon” and the near-symphonic chorus of “Northern Lights.” “Cruel” comes closest to being a straightforward song, but still threatens to dissipate in a magnetic cloud of overdrive. Clark has managed to make hooks out of her sonic phenomena, and you’ll find yourself anticipating the woodwind flashes, drum breaks and processed guitar solos just as you might a singalong chorus on a more typical pop album. Better still, “Strange Mercy” doesn’t flag, sustaining its mood (guarded but alluring) and its experimental pace (relentless) from beginning to end.

And, of course, Medicare recipients now pay much less for their prescriptions when they reach the donut hole, which, under the PPACA, will be gradually eliminated. This year, Medicare recipients will receive a 50 percent discount on brand-name drugs and a 14 percent discount on generics while in the donut hole. And over time, these benefits will grow, so that, starting in 2020, the donut hole will have disappeared entirely. This means that senior citizens will no longer have to pay premiums for Medicare Part D, the prescription drug program, while having to pay the full cost of their drugs at the same time, as they had to do before the act was passed into law.
6. New York (7) - Thierry Henry scores game-winning goal, but suffers hamstring pull that will sideline him for up to four weeks. How will the Red Bulls fare without Henry, who has figured in 14 - league-leading nine goals and five assists - of New York's 18 goals this season?

Whyte, who took over the club last May, was described as "not a fit and proper person" to be involved in the sport by the Scottish Football Association.

Over the past few years, the Milton Inn has seamlessly introduced options like a $45 chef's tasting menu for diners not ready to commit the necessary funds or attention to restaurant's full dinner menu, which is very expensive. The last time The Baltimore Sun visited the Milton Inn was soon after this innovation was introduced. This time, we went back to the Milton Inn's basics, which really aren't that basic. Somewhere along the way, there has also been a relaxing of the dress code, a mixed blessing.

Opening Thursday, March 15, through Tuesday, March 20: This Tony-winning hit musical comedy follows six young misfits in the throes of puberty as they compete in an "actual" spelling bee. And they're overseen by grown-ups who barely managed to escape childhood themselves. This amusing tale of overachievers' angst is the unlikeliest of musicals about the unlikeliest of heroes: a quirky yet charming cast of outsiders for whom a spelling bee is the one place where they can stand out and fit in at the same time. Before every performance, four audience volunteers are recruited to participate on-stage as guest spellers, so every performance is different. Recommended for ages 8 and up.

The era of runaway spending and higher and higher taxes has not worked. We have the largest budget deficit per person of any State in the Union. We have the highest tax rates in the nation. We have the highest unemployment rate in over a quarter century. Our economy is stagnant and our people are suffering under the burden government has placed on them. And we cannot continue to mortgage our future if we hope to improve it. Today, we are taking a new direction. Today, a new era of lower taxes and higher growth will begin now . Today, change has arrived.

Granted, their bill wouldn't reduce the amount flowing to the trust funds for Social Security and Medicare -- the point is just to make the numbers add up in the unified federal budget, where revenue into the trust fund counts against spending on other programs. But at a time when the long-term health of Social Security and Medicare is in question, it seems politically foolish to use payroll-tax revenue to offset anything other than the cost of those programs.
The Belknaps swept, mopped and scrubbed the two shacks the Wilshire league runs before opening day. To keep shelves stocked through the 11 weeks of the season, Gretchen Belknap runs to Costco and the United Grocers Cash & Carry once a week.

Opponents included lawmakers from both parties. A handful of Democrats and Republicans rose in vain to try and stop the DUI blood standard. Sen.

In the area from the foul line to the no-charge arc, betwixt the daintiness of pull-up jumpers and the clatter and clash of driving layups, Jamison thrives. Cavs coach Mike Brown variously called it Thursday the area from 15 to 13 feet away, or from 10 to 12 feet from the rim, but he could have called it the land of the lost. The popularity of the 3-point shot made the intermediate jumper a lost art, but few players even practice shots in Jamison's 'tweener land.

It does not appear that this allegation, if true, could lead to any penalties for Ohio State.

Grade – 3.5: Oregon has enough athletes at defensive end to believe that this group will be able to fly around and make plays while remaining fresh.

"Some information came to light in media reports that prompted further investigation on our part of her ability to provide proper care for foster children," said Lizelda Lopez, spokeswoman for the Department of Social Services. "We no longer believe she should have foster children in her care."
It was perhaps the most impressive display of corporate sponsorship at the annual festival, which started out 25 years ago as a way to showcase indie bands but has since become a massive, mainstream music event. Chevrolet, Pepsi and FreeCreditScore.com were among 10 official sponsors of the festival, while Taco Bell, Marlboro and Spotify joined other big business names whose banners adorned Austin's dozens of live music stages.
Perlman and De Silva didn't define those styles to optimum effect, suggesting that they hadn't played (or rehearsed) these works recently. Although they occupied the same stage, the musicians weren't always on the same interpretive page.

On nights like this, we see the Hall of Fame journey mostly from the perspective of the man being enshrined. And that's how it ought to be. But it also can be reflected in the tears and cheers, the smiles and the emotions of the faces in the crowd. And so it was on this night that began so fittingly in a oversized high school stadium hard by Interstate 77, with Steve Sabol planting a tender kiss on his father's forehead. The air was still resonating with the distinctive sounds and memorable images that Ed Sabol helped create through NFL Films. Now, at 94 years old, he is finally getting his due as the finest poet laureate this game has ever known.
Parking is not for the faint of heart or those prone to pinching pennies. The private lots are fairly pricey and not well illuminated. The closer you park to the desirable restaurants and clubs, the more light you get, but the less money you have left to spend. The handful of street parking meters that are available go usually to the early birds.
That leaves West Side Ald. Jason Ervin (28th) feeling left out.
Things got better when TE/FB Bear Pascoe came in for FB Henry Hynoski, but I’m not going to throw Hynoski under the bus because he’s been pretty good for a rookie. And while it looked like he was running past defenders Sunday, the times I noticed that were when people in front of him whiffed on their blocks. So he either missed the free guy because he was headed for his assignment or, on one play, he had to clean up the mess after a missed block and never got to his guy.
Chances were high that those would be home rather than commercial cellars. During Prohibition, residents could continue to make wine for their own consumption.
"The cost of it is quite prohibitive at this point," said attorney Sheila Meer, who represented Aquino in the administrative case. "He really isn't in the position to carry the fight for the younger doctors. This is a political issue."
For the sauce: Heat oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in cinnamon, then quickly add onion and garlic. Stir and cook until aromatic, about 15 seconds. Whisk in ketchup, tomato paste, brown sugar, fish sauce, thyme, Dijon, sriracha and lemon juice. Add salt and pepper to taste, then add espresso. Cool and refrigerate; the sauce can be made a few days ahead. Reheat when ready to use. Makes about 1 1/2 cups; reserve extra for another use.
It's easy to see that smart grid's wealth of information offers an opportunity to reduce a monthly bill. But its tiered system of charges also could carry a sting for those who don't want to be bothered. Customers who don't use the smart-meter information, or don't understand it, could instead be stuck with higher bills.
When Vega was arrested, he was council president. He refused to resign, saying he is innocent of the charges, but eventually gave up the presidency.

Yet these filmmakers can't overcome the same problem creator Adam Herz faced in the previous three movies: The women  with the exception of the quirky Hannigan  are boring. Stars Tara Reid, Mena Suvari and Natasha Lyonne are interchangeble, and the plot grinds to a halt whenever they appear. Perhaps it's not feasible to create well-rounded female characters in a series based on male lust.

A sense of danger has been noticeably missing for a long time now. Also missing is the notion that we're watching a company of players flying by the seat of its pants. No doubt "Saturday Night Live" is a workout. In the best-case scenario, it should leave the audience catching its breath as well.

Ravi Sinha maintained that composure as he spoke of his family’s stroll around their Old Bridge neighborhood and how it changed in an instant. How four young men rushed up to them and, for no comprehensible reason, began raining blows and kicks on Ravi and his father. How his father crumpled to the ground and screamed in pain.

"I tell everybody who comes in here, 'Bring it on!'" the 62-year-old says, at ease in his new uniform: long camouflage shorts, a T-shirt and tennis shoes. "I trust my customers. I don't stare at them when they shop. I don't look at their clothes or where they have their hands. I don't argue if they don't have exact change. I just say, 'OK, you pay me next time, OK?' and I smile."

From her earliest memories, Koeppe has been an artist. Born in Brooklyn, Koeppe was accepted at the prestigious Cooper Union in New York. She was studying art there when, by chance, she met the love of her life while waiting in line to tour the 1937 World's Fair: a young man on his way to a Christian conference in Amsterdam.
How bad is the problem? The Treasury Department and Department of Education have teamed the past three years to assess financial literacy in U.S. high schools, and the results haven't been pretty: the average score of almost 76,900 students in 2010 was 70%. Last year's testing of about 84,000 students and this year's of about 80,000 students were both a point lower: 69%.

U.S. Rep. Rush Holt (NJ-12):
But there are images more inspiring from cities that have removed elevated highways that bifurcated and isolated neighborhoods. They are of parkways and grand boulevards and rejuvenated business districts. This may yet be within our reach. We have opportunity. We have the ability. We have the capacity. If an answer lies beyond our reach, let it not be because we lacked imagination.

• The New York Times' Harvey Araton thinks Carmelo Anthony has more on the line than Heat star LeBron James: "But there is another side to this high-profile showdown, another superstar whose reputation is on the line, or should be, in the best-of-seven series that will begin Saturday afternoon in Miami. The argument can be made that Carmelo Anthony has more to prove than James over the next 10 days to two weeks... He and the Knicks have to get out of the first round, or come darn close, if there is to be a positive spin put on the season for player and team alike."

The six-month anniversary of the nation’s health care reform law today ushered in new benefits, such as allowing adults up to age 26 to obtain coverage through their parents’ plan. The law also prevents insurance companies from imposing lifetime monetary caps on a patient’s care, and provides everyone with free preventative care. In New Jersey, consumer advocates say the new benefits will help residents while business leaders worry about cost. How it will work:
The Red Wings pulled goalie Jimmy Howard to add an extra skater with 1:31 left, but put him back in the net because Henrik Zetterberg was called for high-sticking with 55.8 seconds left. David Legwand's power-play goal, with 39 seconds left, sealed the win.

To compensate for drastic reductions in allowable harvest, the 1994 Northwest Forest Plan provided for "transition payments." But because most counties had few realistic economic alternatives to transition to, Congress enacted a stopgap, the ironically titled Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act (SRS), on which counties like Curry have since been dependent. With the expiration of SRS payments last year and PILT payments this year, Western delegations in Congress have been scrambling for extensions.

Finally, there's the age-old debate: Vodka or gin? Many believe this decision comes down to personal preference. St. Regis' Washington hotel votes in favor of gin with its Capitol Mary, made with Tanqueray Tan gin and topped with olives and a shrimp. Still, if you're a traditionalist, you might want to stick with vodka - any brand, since the alcohol's flavor is masked by the tomatoes and spices.

Now Bechdel does herself one better with a tender and wide-ranging examination of her relationship with her living mother, an actress and critic with a crisp surface and an intricate interior. Lacking "Fun Home's" high profile melodrama, "Are You My Mother?" is all the more erudite, subtle and charming. Its cool, elegant drawings are rendered in black, white and many shades of gray. Decades of drawing a syndicated comic strip have distilled Bechdel's skills to depict mood, thought and event in the shifting body language of her figures. But here the images have become more complex and visually interesting. While this book is definitely written, the drawings and the text are inextricable and mutually illuminating.

Other e-mails show Fakhouri ordered county department heads to support Ficano's annual fund-raising gala by selling $500 tickets.

Ted Drewes, of course, seems to top the list, but part of that is a reward of longevity, tradition and great media exposure. Drewes is a cross-generational institution that really deserves the often overused descriptor of "iconic." I know people who drive in from Wildwood to satisfy a Ted Drewes craving, and how many custard stands need traffic cops to keep customers from blocking the street?

"It's a little different obviously in NASCAR. When you hit in an Indy car, you hit quick. There is a lot less recoil. It's like you hit and you slide along the wall. Where I feel like in a stock car, oddly enough, the impacts feel kind of bigger. I think it is because of the room you can move and that the cars bounce a little bit more when they hit. They don't just crush and slow down."

Many of the same preparations are brought to bear on lamb, beef and seafood: tikka masala, saag (that's the forest-green chopped spinach sauce) and rogan josh (a kind of brown, mild curry heady with cardamom rogan is Persian for clarified butter, josh means passionate).

Scoop it onto rice and adorn it on all sides with condiments like a cilantro-mint chutney or salty-spicy achaar (classic Indian pickled veggies marinated in citrus and chile) or a sweet mango chutney.

It would be silly to expect exact fealty to a 1960s sitcom. A musical has different requirements -- enthusiasm, gusto, big smiles. I get that. But at some point, we don't know who these people are anymore. Enthusiasm? Morticia would be mortified.

“He can really pinpoint things, whether it’s between periods, or opponents about what the read is, what the specific read is for your opponent, what they’re trying to do.

The Blue Ribbon Commission on Transportation Funding has recently announced its recommendations to significantly increase the gas tax and to double vehicle registration and inspection fees, taking over $900 million per year out of Marylanders' pockets. While some jobs may well be created, there is no doubt that some will also be lost due to the significant impact on the cost of moving goods and food, traveling to work and transporting children to school and activities.

The net result will create more of a financial burden for families and small businesses in the midst of economic hard times.

NBC has announced that "Community" will return on March 15, which is glorious news to its fans. Though that show -- about a mismatched, but doggedly devoted group of community college classmates -- is too much of a unique, acquired taste to ever command "Big Bang Theory" numbers.

Then there was George H.W. Bush calling Ronald Reagan's trickle-down economics -- giving tax cuts and breaks to the rich and conglomerates like GE -- "voodoo economics." That same trickle-down economics was revisited by George W. Bush when he gave two sizable tax cuts to the wealthy with the promise that jobs would follow. Fact is, more jobs were lost -- 700,000 a month in the run-up to the financial disaster in September 2008 -- under George W. Bush than at any other time since the Great Depression.

We are taught to believe the opposite, that "black" and "white" are self-evident and immutable. But I invite you to look up Walter White, the blond, blue-eyed "Negro" who once led the NAACP, or Gregory Howard Williams, the university president who didn't even know he was black until he was 10 years old. Dig up the old Jet magazine story about a woman who gave birth to twins -- one "black," one "white." And then think again. Race is a fraud, a cruel and stupid fraud.

4. Finally, we believe that additional legislation can help address this problem. The Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, passed in 2009, makes it easier for women to recover back wages when they discover long-term wage discrimination.

The answer resides in his range. Descalso possesses a plus arm and plus glove. However, third base is a reaction position while second base and shortstop are range positions. Questions about DD's range led TLR to expose him more at third base in Seotember 2010. David Freese's injury necessitated playing time there in 2011. Descalso is a very intelligent, heads-up player. I anticipate he'll pick up quickly on nuances such as positioning to help offset any range deficiencies. Of equal importance is whether he can consistently generate offense with greater exposure. After hitting .204 through May 21, the Gold Glove nominee at third base reached .270 on Sept.13 before settling at .264. However, Descalso managed only four RBI and six extra-base hits in his last 116 at-bats.

Those candidates are believed to be Oklahoma City assistant general manager Troy Weaver, Los Angeles Clippers general manager Neil Olshey, San Antonio assistant GM Dennis Lindsey, former New Orleans GM Jeff Bower, former Phoenix assistant GM (now in Cleveland) David Griffin and longtime NBA general manager Ed Stefanski (now in Toronto).

Biggest disappointment: Imprisoned innocents. Despite proof that innocent people have been imprisoned in Brevard County — three men have already been exonerated — none of the state officials who could call for an independent investigation into the matter has done so.

If next year's Republican primary electorate looks like the Tea Party -- focused on fiscal responsibility, lower taxes and smaller government above all else -- Daniels could be a strong candidate. He took Indiana from deficit to surplus, cut state spending and won re-election by a landslide in 2008, even as Democrat Barack Obama narrowly won the state's presidential vote. Term limits mean he's out of a job after 2012; he'll be looking for something to do, no matter what.

A: The stop-start feature you mention is gaining popularity as car makers intensify their efforts to save fuel and increase fuel economy. Many drivers have turned their engines off manually during short halts for decades and the practice has long been common in Europe. It seems reasonable to assume that doing so will shorten the life of certain components, your starter in particular, because it simply increases the amount of work those parts must do. However, I haven't heard of a notable increase in starter failures among people who do this.

The Blazers (25-29), still trying to make one final push at a playoff berth, failed to back up Monday’s win over Minnesota with another and wasted a season-high 33 points from guard Wesley Matthews. Portland has not had consecutive wins since January 23-24. A win would have been even more meaningful because the Blazers would have beaten two teams in a row that are above them in the standings.

So I thought: If I would go dance, get away from sports and have fun, it would help me get my confidence back.

Arizona's far-reaching law, which takes effect July 29, provides enough legitimate fodder for an all-out policy argument on the roles of states in immigration enforcement, which is recognized as a federal government responsibility. Arizona has made it a state crime to be in the United States illegally and requires local police to pursue the immigration status of people they reasonably suspect might be undocumented. Opponents blast the law as unconstitutional not only because they believe Arizona has overstepped its authority but also because they predict it will lead to civil-rights abuses.
Smith describes the various ways many of his colleagues undercut the interests of investors in order to make more money for themselves and the company.

That foraging is dangerous. Newbies sometimes assume that there are many lethal plants and that it could be tricky to identify them -- but once you know how to identify a particular species, you're really unlikely to get it mixed up with another. Plants all have unique characteristics. The stems have hair or thorns or no hair at all, the leaves are shaped a particular way and have a particular texture, the structure of the branching happens in one of many specifics patterns, and so on.
Hardin also challenged the notion that Clemens testified voluntarily in 2008.

In Oakland County, about $3 billion worth of assessment is challenged, down from about $3.9 billion at this time last year, said Deputy County Executive Robert Daddow. In 2010, the county budgeted more than $12 million to cover losses in case half of the assessment value was challenged successfully, Daddow said. But the county's losses will be less than that because the appeals are running only about 30% successful, he said.

Social Security wasn't designed to offer such generous terms to those who wait. Amendments in 1956 and 1961 gave participants a choice to collect benefits as early as 62 rather than wait until full retirement age, then 65.

There was just a report, either in your paper or no Bloomberg, about that this country is facing a $1.2 trillion deficit just two weeks ago. And Tom walked me through how bad our system is, both water, sewer pumping stations, etc., and he said how much we spend on just emergencies like wells yesterday or last week, over the weekend, which was a 99-year-old pipe. Again, I don't go chasing tough issues. Listen, you asked me. Tom presented here as every commissioner did when we were talking about this and I asked him questions: What are you doing? Are you set up to do what you're supposed to do? Is this the best way to do it? What do you got to do to change? Tom presented what was the basic problem currently of the water infrastructure and the sewer system. Then I went through a process of what would it take to fix it and I asked him to come back with a series of plans. He came back and there were like five or six options. Then, like always I narrowed it down, I'm doing this by memory, two to three. We massaged a couple of those both on what the work would be, how to get it, and then I basically made a decision that I was going to present to the public through the budget speech in an attempt to deal with what has been an underfinanced, and we're not me, this is true across the country. We are launching the largest water infrastructure investment of any city. This is a cloud, problem even your own paper has written about because we spend somewhere around, I'm doing this by memory so I could be off, $30 to $35 million dollars doing emergency work and I have been working on, you know, how I am going to do this and in Congress I did what the problem is and what we thought it would take to fix it. What was originally proposed is not what I then ultimately settled on, but it is something we agreed to do to get the job done.
Improving education at all levels of our society is the key to a large middle class who can thrive and obtain the American Dream.
The Milpitas City Council meeting of April 3 should be a resounding wake-up call for local residents who resent hidden forces using political clout and threats to personnel to gain advantages when it comes to policies relating to land uses and other activities of the city.

In a March 19 letter from Lianides to Berghouse, the superintendent acknowledges that a second document, attached to the honesty pledge, refers to an "old two-strikes policy" and should have been updated. But the signed pledge "clearly states that any incident of cheating or plagiarism will result in the student removal from the class with no exceptions," he wrote.
"This is not a 'Jeopardy!' question where there is just one right answer," said Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, a leader on health care. "House Republicans are committed to repealing the existing Obamacare bill. That's not window dressing, but we are going to do a three-pronged approach. We'll do repeal, we'll do a reform bill, we'll do a defunding bill. It's all of the above."
If adopted, the amended budget will go to the state Division of Local Government Services for review before it receives final approval from the council.
Fickell's deals requires the same, but it now includes "any violations or potential violations." Potential violations cover a lot of ground, but in light of the emails about players potentially selling memorabilia that Tressel failed to report, this small change makes it clear: If the Ohio State football coach even thinks something might be wrong, he has to report it.

A spike in shootings and violence near Ohio and Hamlin streets led Narcotics Divisions Officers to begin their investigation of the corner two months ago.
Why would people seek to prevent new schools from opening, even if that means denying choices to families? Because while educators in traditional public schools here are by law required to be unionized, those in charters decide for themselves whether they want to join a union. For union leaders, this is a fight to remain in control.
There is an art to the sports-figure apology. In most legal cases, athletes need to be careful not to admit they were guilty. This sometimes leads to absurd situations, like athletes getting arrested for brawling in a crystal-meth lab while soliciting a prostitute, then apologizing for . . . distracting their fellow basketball players.
The restaurant itself is a little worn but adequately comfortable. The large mirrors and windows are streaky, and the paint on the walls is dull, but you hardly notice because it's more fun to focus on the young Mission crowd filing into the small dining room.

Even with the cachet of its notorious 45-ton set and a starry cast, onstage, the production was less consistent. For a fantastical opera, there wasn’t as much imagination in the sets as one might have hoped, the color palette was mostly drab, and singers were often forced unflatteringly far upstage. The singers’ performances, while all admirable in their theatrical commitment, were mixed in terms of total payoff.
With an uncontested primary victory under his belt, freshman Wadsworth GOP Rep. Jim Renacci is gearing up for a hotly contested general election battle with Copley Township Democratic Rep. Betty Sutton. The incumbents were placed in the same district by a GOP-controlled state legislature, which had to eliminate two of Ohio’s current 18 congressional seats because the state’s population has grown more slowly than other parts of the country.
Completing those cosmetic fixes are not enough to overcome what the Vikings and many state leaders agree is a more significant flaw: The building's design makes it difficult for the team to maximize profits.

The tradition calls for a tiny plastic (or porcelain in those days) baby to be placed inside the rosca. Whoever bites into that part of the rosca and finds a baby doll must throw another party on Feb. 2, Día de la Candelaria, or Candelmas.

But neither he nor any of the other six passengers were experienced directors.

As much as Anderson’s reputation has been helped by the hiring of men’s basketball coach Mark Turgeon, his legacy at Maryland will ultimately be tied to Edsall.

Hey, Mary Kay: Our defense is closer to competing in our division than our offense is. Wouldn't it make sense to get those final pieces for our young defense in this draft and let the so-called "offensive gurus" we have on our staff coach up the offense? If we can re-sign D'Qwell Jackson and get a top prospect at defensive end and cornerback in the first round, and comeback and with more defensive tackle depth behind the mammoth duo of Rubin and Taylor, we might have the makings of a truly dominant defense. -- Kellen Kelly, Los Angeles, Calif.

Martinez Armstrong of the 1800 block of N. Bond St. was charged with being a felon in possession of a gun and reckless endangerment after investigators made a forensic match on the .22-caliber rifle. Court records show he was being held on $500,000 bond.
The quest to form a solid offensive front from left to right seemingly is endless. After doling out big bucks in free agency in 2009 to veterans Floyd Womack and John St. Clair, the Browns made two more additions this year. They signed ex-Raven Tony Pashos in free agency and drafted Arizona State's Shawn Lauvao in the third round. Pashos was signed to start at right tackle. Lauvao will compete with Womack to start at right guard. Left guard Eric Steinbach, one of a handful of NFL starting offensive linemen under 300 pounds and thought to be a potential casualty because of a $5.75 million salary, would appear to be safe another year. The absence of a salary cap certainly helps Steinbach.

Given Kilo's appeal and workplace productivity, it seems hard to believe that Negrea fought to have a K-9 on the force. "I approached the city a number of times," recalls Negrea, "but they had tried police dogs once or twice in the eighties and it didn't work out." Negrea framed his argument for a dog in terms of the emerging emphasis on community relations. "We are the courtesy city," expresses Negrea, "and I felt a police dog could help extend that sense of courtesy into the community."
Recent ownership changes at four high-profile resorts have brought an influx of capital geared to heighten Tahoe's allure as a ski destination.

I used to run track in junior high school and I played sports in junior high school. I'm somewhat of an athlete so I didn't have a problem with it. Me and Warren were kind of complaining in the first couple of episodes about all the foot chases. And, you know, the reality is, real detectives and beat cops do a lot more foot chasing than they do shootouts. The idea that someone could be a detective for 25 years and maybe pull their gun once is kind of like, 'OK, I'll take the foot chase.' I don't think I can be on TV as a cop if I never got to pull my gun, so let's chase some people.

Instead, McCaskill is, at least, hoping her choice of scenery will convey voters that she shares their concern. Although if middle-class voters listened to her pitch, they'd hear it was more about others paying more, instead of drivers paying less.

That's all well and good, but the teams still in the playoffs are being forced to deal with the implications on the fly. They know, for example, that while the number of games lost to injury is up, points and shooting percentages are down.

ø"It'd be great, if not for the fact that a planet of Sith believers is always a disaster waiting to happen," the writer says.

A: He has to rest them. These guys are exhausted. I understand pushing through against New York, since you want to make a statement if you meet them in the playoffs, or possibly push them to a lower seed. But then enough is enough. What many fail to realize is that after this four-games-in-five-nights run that ends Monday in New Jersey, the Heat then open another four-in-five on Wednesday night. Yes, eight games in 11 nights. No one should have to play through that, coach through that, or even write through that.

Wurzelbacher became a symbol of blue-collar America after Sen. John McCain mentioned him in a 2008 presidential debate.

Q. Pasolini is pretty sensational.
What, pray tell, is there to be embarrassed about? Yarvin is a fervent champion of traditional British cuisine. He truly loves the odd bits of animal, forsaken seafood (jellied eel!) and neglected vegetables -- he practically waxes poetic about the pocked, almost impenetrable rutabaga he attacks with a cleaver while preparing lamb cawl, a Welsh stew often eaten on March 1, St. David's Day.

Cherepinsky's Facebook profile identifies him as WalterFootball.com's "overlord," and there's a cheeky irreverence to the website that includes a "Jerks Of The Week" feature and a snippy section about Emmitt Smith's shortcomings as an announcer.

California prisons are awful places. The walls are gray, the space is crowded and the threat of violence is always present. Every day, prison staff must guard against vengeful inmates who would slash their arms or throw urine in their face.
I did not take into account where the current council members live, figuring that should not be a factor. What's important is what is most logical for the residents -- things like not splitting towns or creating oddly shaped districts.

"I'm no expert on the Browns, but after seeing them let Peyton Hillis go and sign, for such a little amount of money, to Kansas City it's obvious they need help at running back," the scout said. "If they really want to help support Colt on offense, then there is no better way to do that than to draft Trent. He is the type of back who will help the passing game via running the football, by blocking incoming pass rushers/blitzes and Trent can be a passing outlet for McCoy when things really break down inside the pocket."

The state is in the process of phasing out the old method of deciding whether a property is eligible for the cap on property-tax increases. Before, all you had to do was indicate in land records that the home would be your principal residence -- something that contributed to abuse of the break, both accidental and on purpose. Now you must specifically apply for the credit and verify -- under penalty of perjury -- that you're eligible.
Trinitario ("from Trinidad") cacao seems to have been a natural hybrid of Criollo and Forastero that originated in Trinidad after Forastero was introduced to the local Criollo crop in the 18th century. Trinitario combines some of the superior Criollo taste with Forastero's disease resistance.

Grilled beef ($15) was good too, in a hearty, family-style way, served with amazingly potent mashed sweet potatoes and lovely green beans.
The best defense for everyone is to wear brimmed hats and sunglasses that screen 99 to 100 percent of UV rays. Brimmed hats alone will block about 50 percent of UV radiation. Ideally, all types of eyewear should absorb at least the full spectrum of UV rays including UV-A and UV-B. The degree of UV protection is not necessarily related to the price of the sunglasses. Most rigid contact lenses also provide UV protection -- but because contact lenses don't cover the entire eye, it's still important to wear sunglasses when you're outdoors.
Best seat: At the bar, especially if wine director and co-owner Pamela S. Busch is there in her trademark boots.

She'll let you know why you really should try this wine with that dish.
1. Beef up the coordination of early-on, whole-child supports. Track it. Some of this is being undertaken through a new, multiyear grant to Denver from the Wallace Foundation.

And yet, sure enough, when October 15th came around, of the 15 players that the Yankees were protecting, Mantle was not among them. While I don't know for sure what their reasoning is, it likely was a matter where they were unsure if Mantle was going to come back for 1969 or not. They knew he'd give it a try, but they did not know if it would actually happen. And if it did not, they would have "wasted" a spot protecting a player who was not going to play for them. So they gambled and left him unprotected. However, while Mantle was unprotected, they obviously did not want anyone to actually draft him. They contacted the front offices of the Seattle Pilots and the Kansas City Royals and asked them not to pick Mantle. They even enlisted the President of the AL, Joe Cronin, to put pressure on them not to take Mantle. After all, this was Mickey Mantle! How could he not play for the Yankees? The Pilots agreed and the Royals also agreed...at least at first.
Though he had been toying with getting into the business somehow, the idea solidified at that first beer week three years ago after he ran into a high school friend who had the same hunch. The two had a mutual friend who was a brewer at an established Maryland brewery - Zerivitz declines to say which - who had also been eager to start his own business. Zerivitz said his two partners weren't available to talk because it would jeopardize their current jobs, which they haven't left yet.

We spent the rest of the afternoon in a state of giddy satisfaction, grateful for the sun on our faces, the sturdiness of our legs and the wonder of encountering things striking and new — from tiny white insects whose brilliant blood is prized as a dye, to gardens of Day-Glo dahlias as big as dinner plates — at every pass.

You've got to rely on the people that are there," Ginger said. "That doesn't mean you might not have to do some training, communication and demonstration on how things are supposed to work. The key to the monitoring process really is to build the core competencies within the organization so that when you leave, they stay there."

The reason it's so crucial for politicians to activate both negative and positive emotions is that they are not, as our intuition would suggest, just opposites. Emotions such as anxiety, fear and disgust involve very different neural circuits than, say, happiness or enthusiasm.

But deciding exactly what adjustments to make, striking the correct balance between reductions in benefits and increasing taxes, will require a give and take.

Few restaurants built from the ground up are so fully realized so rapidly, but then few places get the expertise of owner Nick Peyton, who learned his craft at the Ritz-Carlton, went into partnership with Gary Danko and then moved to St. Helena to start the homey Market. Along the way, he got together with Douglas Keane, who became his partner at Market.

No one is eager to see the U.S. embroiled in yet another foreign war in addition to the current conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and, most recently, Libya. But what good does it do to say America is committed to the Arab people's struggle for freedom and democracy if all that means is that the U.S. will stand by as a passive spectator while the brave demonstrators trying to bring that about are mowed down in the streets like animals brought to slaughter?

Ashley Wheater, artistic director of the Joffrey Ballet and therefore student of the rigid classical dance that would seem to be the polar opposite of Bausch's experimentalism, heartily agrees. "She's a giant in the expressionistic dance world, to the point I'd love to bring some of her work to the Joffrey, and we're trying to do it." That would have a full-circle quality to it: Robert Joffrey's revival of the 1932 "The Green Table," by Bausch's mentor, Jooss, broadened Jooss' reputation in America. It returns this fall.

A New England sort of charm colors the atmosphere in the trim, cozy space that unfolds behind this Chagrin Falls landmark.

2. Guard Steve Blake: Whenever Kobe Bryant touts the Lakers' good chances in winning a championship, he always rattles off the team's size, versatility and experience. But he always makes sure to add that the Lakers become a dramatically more dangerous team when they shoot well from three-point range. No one on the bench has a bigger responsibility and more of a green light to shoot those shots than Blake. But will he? Any standout performance, such as his 13-point effort last week on three-for-five shooting from three-point range against Oklahoma City, only come in spurts.
A sampling of Cleveland police incident reports obtained by The Plain Dealer reveals that in some three dozen documented incidents between 2005 and 2010 MetroHealth's security guards acted as police: They handcuffed people and placed them in holding cells, read them their Miranda rights, patted them down, searched vehicles, placed people under arrest, and collected statements from victims and witnesses. In many cases, the reports note, officers from the Cleveland Police Department were called only after the offenders were in a holding cell.

1. At least 2 days before you plan to serve the dish, make the marmalade. Juice oranges and refrigerate the juice. Scrape out and discard the pulp. Place the orange rinds into a small saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring the water to a simmer, then refrigerate until cool. When cool, return to the stove and bring to a simmer. Again, refrigerate until cool. Repeat once more. (This step eliminates bitterness in the rinds.)

Despite recent speculation the Vikings would choose LSU cornerback Morris Claiborne or even Oklahoma State wide receiver Justin Blackmon, they ultimately wound up with the player who's been most widely projected to land in Minnesota all along.
Danilo Gallinari was the centerpiece of New York's trade package to land Carmelo Anthony last season, but the athletic 6-foot-10 Italian (14.6 ppg.) didn't fully blossom this season. His 32.6 percent on 3-pointers was surprisingly poor, and he remains subpar in many of the game's subtleties.

Carolina Herrera also set the bar high. While some explore other eras or other worlds, Herrera knows how to turn out an elegant outfit, without gimmicks.

In "God Bless America," Joel Murray is an honest man near suicide, disgusted by how cruel and crude society has become, finding a purpose in exterminating rude people. He picks up a teenage-girl accomplice, in the great tradition of outlaw couple films like "Bonnie and Clyde" and "Badlands." It's a blood-soaked movie about comeuppance and rage that, in these mad-as-hell days, has struck a chord with film-festival audiences.

“We have to see what we did wrong in that first half so we come out (tonight) and understand what not to do,” Rutgers junior Dane Miller said following the Scarlet Knights’ regular-season finale on Saturday, a 61-58 win over St. John’s. “Just not turn the ball over. Make sure we stay on top of the formula and the game plan. We all feel like the first half, we were a little bit selfish defensively and offensively. If we come out and play together, we have a real big chance of getting that win.”

These shifting religious sands have brought about a structural change in the relationship between politics and religion in the United States. Once, the key religious divides were among Protestants, Catholics and Jews; now they're between conservatives and liberals within every faith. On election day, conservative Protestants have more in common with conservative Catholics than with liberal Presbyterians.

Toobin, a reporter for The New Yorker, unveils the inner workings of the last 15 years of the Supreme Court, updating "The Bretheren," Bob Woodward and Scott Armstrong's 1979 book about the Court under Chief Justice Warren Burger. "The Nine" drew critical praise for its compelling portrait of the court, but The Christian Science Monitor also noted that Toobin deviates from an objective viewpoint: "Readers who share the author's left-of-center outlook will likely delight in Toobin's account. Others looking for a more nuanced, politically neutral analysis may have to search elsewhere. As will many conservatives."

The city did it again last June but forgave the $247 charge after Eastman complained to the city.

Yanwen Xia opines in an April 30 Blog Bit that a dastardly conspiracy occurred in 2009 to obstruct and handicap the new president. Of course, Democrats never lower themselves as to plan (conspire) a strategy to advance their causes. They are too pure and ethical to stoop so low as to plan how to protect their interests.

We are not naïve about the existence of forces in the world which work against peace and against human security, but it is our fervent wish that we shall never become like those whom we condemn as lawless and without scruples. For it is our duty as members of a democratic society to provide leadership by example, to not only articulate the highest standards but to walk down the path to peace and justice with those standards as our constant companions. Our moral leadership in the world depends chiefly upon the might and light of truth and not shock and awe, and ghastly glow of our 2,000 lb bombs.

Burton’s timing couldn’t be better. Under new offensive coordinator Frank Cignetti, the fullback position will be relevant once again at Rutgers.

Occupy Wall Street protesters clogged streets and tied up traffic around the U.S. on Thursday to mark two months since the movement's birth and signal they aren't ready to quit, despite the breakup of many of their encampments by police. Hundreds of people were arrested, most of them in New York.
I tweaked the recipe in a few places. After sampling the cookies with and without their chocolate coating, I preferred the latter. The former, while closer in spirit to the Thin Mints ideal, becomes the very definition of overkill, although the coating's semisweet chocolate is a nice foil to the cookie's sharper cocoa bite. The coating was also taking forever to set, so I transferred the coated cookies to the refrigerator, and that did the trick. It also reminded me: Aren't Thin Mints better when swiped from the freezer?
A few of the contributors are scientists themselves. Scientists who write well about their science are rare birds, and some of the best are here: Martin Rees (the society's outgoing president), Richard Dawkins, Paul Davies, John D. Barrow, Ian Stewart and Gregory Benford. Dawkins, who is now probably better known as a militant atheist than as an evolutionary biologist, predictably celebrates Darwin's demolition of the Rev. William Paley's "argument from design." Paley argued in the 18th century that just as a pocket watch cannot have assembled itself, we and the rest of the biota are the products of a designer. "The answer is cumulative natural selection," Dawkins writes, and he even backs toward teleology: "Provided that a smoothly cumulative gradient of improvement exists ... natural selection is likely to find it, and will propel evolution up the slopes of 'Mount Improbable' to apparently limitless heights of perfection." Amen.

There have been widespread reports, and accusations raised by Republican presidential contenders, that the administration is not heeding the advice of its military commanders in a war over which the American public has become weary and disillusioned. Recent opinion polls indicate that a majority of Americans want a faster drawdown.
But some parents feel the law doesn't go far enough. For one thing, stocking epinephrine in schools is voluntary. And, in most states, it can only be administered by the school nurse, who, in the event of a child having an anaphylactic reaction, might not be able to reach the child's classroom or lunchroom in time. Some parents and food-allergy advocacy groups believe administering epinephrine should be part of a teacher's regular first-aid training.

After a day at the temples, I like to head to Nishiki Market, a wonderful little world of inexpensive thrills in an expensive city.

Twenty years ago, Tyler used her character Ian Bedloe in "Saint Maybe" to cover similar ground.

Bohn did not reveal a priority list of proposed improvements but acknowledged that football coaches have been telling prospective recruits this spring that the construction of an indoor football practice facility is in the planning stages.
Here's a different take: If the Nuggets don't finish among the top six teams in the Western Conference, making the playoffs is fool's errand. If Denver can't finish with at least a No. 6 seed, the team would be better off with a spot in the NBA lottery and a shot at adding young talent such as Duke's Austin Rivers or Connecticut's Jeremy Lamb in the draft.
But advocates of the bill, which has been adopted in at least 19 other states, wonder if drivers even know about it.
Although the FDA is legally barred from considering cost when reviewing drugs, health care providers raised concerns about Truvada's price tag: $900 a month, or just under $11,000 per year.

Meanwhile, there remain concerns about the financial viability of the Maloofs as NBA owners and of having a third NBA team in the L.A. market, SI.com's Sam Amick. Given all the machinations that are underway, is it too late for Sacramento?
Very often, a spouse doesn't speak up for fear of hurting the other person. Men are particularly bad about this, psychologists say. They typically have a tougher time expressing emotions and don't like to feel they are letting their wives down. They may immerse themselves in work or other activity and become distant.

Sometimes it's hard to get to a performance on time. There are the vicissitudes of bad weather, human forgetfulness (speaking as someone who had to turn around on New Year's Eve and retrieve the tickets from the kitchen table), and people who aren't ready when they say they will be. MoDOT's the-public-be-damned approach to highway work has, of course, ratcheted up the problem by several orders of magnitude for a two-year span.

Hollinger's characters tend to be single-note character types, but they're funny character types. The lively student actors in this UMBC production have fun indulging their stereotypical characters, and they occasionally find nuances beyond what one might expect from the, er, bare bones psychology in the script.

Opponents say it will be struck down in court. Some provisions push the legal envelope, and if they are invalidated, it will mean going back to bargaining that has failed in the past. That's not a great prospect. But if Measure B does not pass, city unions and the council members they support will assume voters can live with the status quo.

But if you lose these senses suddenly, or if you notice a significant change in your ability to smell and taste, see your doctor, as certain medications or an underlying medical problem could be to blame.

-Vog remains an issue: Volcano fog is the result of activity from eruptions from Kilauea that began in 1983. But vog became an issue on the island with the extensive venting of gases from the Halemaumau Crater beginning in 2008. The fumes are dangerously close to the venting point at Kilauea, and roads and hiking trails have been closed. The vog can float up the Kona and Kohala coasts, making for hazy days and atomic-colored sunsets because of the particles. The sulfur dioxide is especially hazardous only near the volcano, but those with respiratory ailments, the very young and the very old should monitor vog conditions. You can do that at the website run by the Vog Measurement and Prediction Project of the University of Hawaii, Hilo. Go to mkwc. ifa.hawaii.edu/vmap/index .cgi for up-to-date forecasts and modeling of wind currents. A recorded daily forecast of volcano activity can be heard by dialing 808-967-8862.

Of course I view investment in startup public transit as the solution to both of these dilemmas.

Every person who lives in the city of Chicago should be incensed to the point of financial and political protest that innocent people in the poorer areas of the city are dying every day from gunfire.

* There are other ways for this to happen, but I'm keeping it simple. The objective should be nothing short of winning the final two games and building confidence and a bit of momentum heading into the postseason. Two wins, and it's done, No. 1 in the West. Why should the Blues open themselves to the risk of needing Edmonton to upset Vancouver to hope for a chance to back into the No. 1 spot? Forget that. The Blues need to assert themselves by winning the final two games. And if they screw up the opportunity? Well, it's not as if it means they'll soil the bed in the playoffs. But it wouldn't be a good sign. The Blues had reasonably firm control of the No. 1 seed, then gave way to the Canucks. There is no good reason for that to happen again, not in the final 48 hours of the schedule, with so much at stake.

God speaks to Abraham and Sarah, calling them to embark on a new journey of faith. God spoke through the prophet Jeremiah, shaking things up yet again. This time God declares a strong revision of the covenant, promising to write the law deep within the hearts of God's people, saying "I will forgive their iniquity and remember their sin no more."

"I just don't know," Swarbrick told reporters about where this leaves Notre Dame in a league weakened by two high-profile members departing. "There's so much I don't know at this point, not the least of which is whether it's in fact a done deal.

The white sporting public (a.k.a. paying customers at the turnstiles) desperately wanted to be assured that there was a blond, blue-eyed kid who could out-run and out-hit these newcomers. The classic "Who's better, Mickey Mantle or Willie Mays?" argument was about more than baseball bragging rights. White America needed Mickey Mantle to be an idol, and the Yankees public relations machine, aided and abetted by a silent sporting media, delivered.

Martin Feldstein, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Ronald Reagan, has written: "Cutting tax expenditures is really the best way to reduce government spending." These are deductions, credits and exclusions that litter the tax code and benefit people who itemize on their tax forms. Once in the tax code, these tax expenditures automatically continue without annual congressional review or approval  i.e., they become entitlements.

Hey, Tom: Living in California, I don't get to see many Cavs games. I was wondering about Anderson Varejao's improved offense. Is it a result of having Irving on the floor with him, a lack of offense from the small forwards and shooting guards, or just an improvement in his offensive game? -- J T, San Diego

"I'm amazed at the negative reactions to it, especially with adults," Nolan says. "I really don't see why they get so upset. The other day, a guy asked me what it was doing on here next to guitars used by the rock gods. So we started talking about teen idols and got into a deep, nerdy conversation. I told him, 'The only reason we started talking was because of that skateboard.'"
It concluded, based on interviews with more than 1,200 soldiers and Marines, that because of repeated deployments, troops were increasingly likely to have experienced traumatic events in combat — being wounded, suffering through explosions, seeing comrades killed or wounded, killing the enemy.

Cut simple feet and beak shapes from card stock. Fold up the ends of the shapes to act as tabs. Glue the feet inside the large cup and the beak inside the small cup. Attach googly eyes. Wrap a 6-inch length of 24-gauge craft wire around a pen. (Make sure it's 24-gauge wire.) Use a pushpin to make a hole in the top of the large cup, then insert a full circle of the wire spring. Tape it in place. Bend the other end of the wire into a flat circle and tape it inside the smaller cup. Add feathers with glue or by inserting them into holes made with a pushpin.

On Friday night, I'd gone to the viewing at Hilgenfeld Mortuary in Anaheim. Za'Zell had been laid out in a white dress with a jeweled bodice. Around her shoulders was draped a pink shawl. Pink was her favorite color, and on either side of the casket were sprays of pink flowers, including an arrangement that formed a large block-letter "ZZ" – the name by which many called her. Her face was angelic and unblemished, the brutality surrounding her death nowhere in evidence.
But Tamara Cunningham's piece for Canada.com on a former Ozzy Osbourne drummer who now sells hearing aids himself offers a whole new take on the issue.
The findings come as studies continue on drugs to treat HSDD. "There is still no FDA-approved treatment," Kingsberg said. "It's still a double standard, a gap in women's sexual health versus men's sexual health."
The themes he trumpeted before a joint session of Congress are ones Americans will hear throughout the year as the president works to convince voters he deserves a second term.

Order the lamb vindaloo ($14.95) "Indian hot" and sweat is a certitude. But the slow-simmered lamb and potato hunks are so flavorful and tender that that's, well, water under the bridge. Cool it out with an order of bagara baingan ($10.95), the soft braised eggplant showcased against peanut, coconut and sesame seeds (a winning trio if ever there was one).
I wasn't used to hearing people sound excited about Houston. But as Klineberg warmed to his subject, he practically trembled. On nearly any controversial topic, he told us - abortion, taxes, gay rights - Houston's opinions mirrored those of the wider United States. There was only one exception, he said dramatically. Overwhelmingly, and far more than people from other cities and states, Houstonians agreed with one important statement: "If you work hard in this city, eventually you will succeed."
During the introductions of Game 3 at Portland’s Memorial Coliseum, Dawkins was booed loudly. When Lucas was introduced, the place went nuts. But instead of running to the foul line to stand with his teammates, Lucas shocked everyone in the building.
Out for a walk with her dog, Gaffney sat at an outdoor tables next to Julie's Deli on Visitacion Avenue - a pleasant, tree-lined street in the heart of downtown Brisbane that gradually gains elevation as it runs from the flatlands partly up the eastern slope of San Bruno Mountain.

Hollingsworth came to check on him. "How you doin'?" he asked, all smiles. The stage reluctantly left his quinoa to talk: "So overwhelmed ... trying to do my best ... honored to be here ... just want to learn." Tim nodded, grinning, then squinted. "Gotta visa?"
Madison also said he was horrified by Kaufman's actions in the cover-up: "You tried to frame me, a man you knew was innocent, and send me to prison for the rest of my life."
Cailey’s passing up a tantrum when she’s told she can’t go outside, or Shannon’s stimming less (repetitive body movements — arm flapping, finger waggling — common in people with autism), or the girls’ sitting calmly in a restaurant are all signs of real progress.

The over arching issue is this: How do you protect property rights and the rights of the developmentally disabled without transforming traditional single-family neighborhoods into multi-family neighborhoods filled with rental homes?
Instead, consider tilting your overall stock holdings toward funds or stocks with good dividend yields. For instance, rather than putting all your stock money in an index fund, put a slice of it in a dividend-oriented fund with a yield of 2 percent or more.
KSDK has now preempted two of the three vote-outs on "I'm a Celebrity" -- not because this isn't a very good show but because paid programming is a money-maker.

As for Flynn, Heckert said the Browns were leaning away from signing a veteran free-agent quarterback.
"The Inverted Forest" doesn't always work. The large number of characters that Dalton introduces sometimes make it hard to keep track of them all, and the ending isn't totally satisfying. But the premise is original, and anyone who has ever spent time at a camp in the Ozarks will find familiar situations presented in a seemingly friendly but ultimately unsettling way.
The site is incredibly fast, thanks to Google's powerful servers and the ITA technology. That sets it apart from other sites, which can take anywhere from several seconds to half a minute or more, if you're on a slower Internet connection, to yield results.

Cincinnati especially. Ohio State needs to get over this aversion that dates to the Kennedy Administration. Jerry Lucas and John Havlicek haven't played since the '70s. Bobby Knight, a substitute on those teams, is a media member now, for heaven's sake.
In June, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce's chairmen said it was BP that made five crucial decisions before the Deepwater Horizon well blowout that "posed a trade-off between cost and well safety." One of those decisions: BP opted against conducting a certain kind of test of the integrity of a cement job at the well. The test would have cost more than $128,000 and taken 9 to 12 hours to perform, the committee's letter notes.
Houston had been at rehearsals for the show Thursday, coaching singers Brandy and Monica, according to a person who was at the event but was not authorized to speak publicly about it.

>>The Lake Oswego City Council voted to transfer $1.2 million in service cuts and fund allocations to the school district. Councilors also voted to allow city staff to develop a package of private utility franchise fee increases for three years in order to come closer to a $2 million transfer requested by school board members in February. The proposed school district financial aid package will now be incorporated into the city’s tentative 2011-2012 budget, which can then be confirmed or modified by the council when they vote to finalize the financial plan in June.
I took away a more personal impression from the Motsoaledi Informal Settlement (a.k.a. squatters' camp), where about 20,000 people live in shacks and unemployment is estimated at 60%. "There is no electricity here," resident tour-guide Mandla Shongwe explained. "People are using paraffin for cooking, so there are a lot of fires, especially in winter." Still, Shongwe said: "There is a difference between living in poverty and living in misery."
With the onset of an early spring in the high country, Yosemite's wilderness winter rangers left their station for the year a week ago at 8,600-foot Tuolumne Meadows. Winter ranger Marea Ortiz said bare patches of asphalt on Tioga Road already were appearing before snowplow crews arrived last week.

"They have to win one more game to not have the worst winning percentage in the history of the NBA,'' Scott said. "We're back at the zoo. I think I had to wake them up a little bit in our walkthrough because a few guys were (nonchalant).
Which leads to the third step in this process. If we're going to get any of this done, we're going to need a movement. For 20 years, environmentalists have operated on the notion that we'd get action if we simply had scientists explain to politicians and chief executives that our current ways are unsustainable. That turns out, quite conclusively, not to work. We need to be able to explain to them that continuing in their current ways will end something they actually care about: their careers. And because we'll never have the cash to compete with Exxon, we better work in the currencies we can muster: bodies, spirit, passion.
HP, which has a workforce nearly six times Apple's, has accounted for a similar or larger share of the SV150's sales in the past. Only once in recent years, however, has it also matched Apple's share of SV150 profit. That was in 2008.

Turkeys are capable of making 27 sounds. You don't need to mimic them all, but it helps to master a variety. "It's the same if you went fishing with a single lure. They may not bite it," Carlton says.
Blakeman said there are fault lines throughout the East Coast but scientists have yet to identify where the main ones would be. He said the makeup of the earth's surface in the East Coast ensured that the quake was felt throughout the region.

The first "parent trigger" petition in California, which sought to allow a charter organization to take over a Compton elementary school, ultimately failed amid bitter charges on both sides that parents had been harassed and lied to. The state Board of Education had a chance to make the process less chaotic by requiring open meetings at which both reformers and opponents would lay out their arguments, enabling parents to make an informed decision.

I think if you want to be a line manager, which is really a statement about profit and loss, you've got to want to do it. If you don't want to do that then don't get into running a division, or a company.

People see my scoring numbers and that's really all they see, but I'm smart enough to know the ways I'm going to score there.'"

By far the biggest category of spending we will need to cut, however, is that for programs which actually have merit, and in most cases make sense, but which we simply cannot afford at this time. Like any family, and like forty two other states with constitutionally required balanced budgets, we must live within our means. New Jersey does not have a revenue problem—we already have higher taxes than any other state in the union. We have gone down the road of ever higher taxes to pay for Trenton’s addiction to spending. What has it given us? 10.1 percent unemployment, a dormant economy and a failure of hope for growth in our future. Higher taxes is the road to ruin. We must, and we will, shrink our government.

Of course, it was my bad-influence friends who were making me go, so, one by one, I should start giving them up. By this point, I was told I had to stop talking to my female friends, too.

People who don’t like pop music often believe everything mainstream artists do is driven by the bottom line — that pop is product, and product is always about delivering a satisfactory experience to the customer. But pop is not a fast-food restaurant. Listeners are, up to a certain point, willing to cope with reprocessed content, but if all you’re serving is a gussied-up plate of somebody else’s leftovers, the doors are going to close on your establishment in a hurry. A successful record is always an amalgam of the familiar and the novel, and artists who respect themselves — and their audiences — acknowledge that.

Councilman Darrin Sharif helped assemble the commission, saying the council needed an independent budget analysis. The group of roughly ten community and business leaders includes O’Flaherty — a former aide to Mayor Kenneth Gibson — business consultant Thomas Banker, and Robert Curvin, a senior policy fellow at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. The team assessed city budgets from 1996 on, and conducted numerous interviews with city officials.

Departments on the West Coast are currently experimenting with the next step beyond hot-spot policing, using a computer program based on earthquake prediction technology to "predict" where crimes will happen next. That will take money and manpower to bring here. But even without the technology, hot-spot policing oftentimes turns out to be prescient.
Caseworkers also face other challenges that eat up time. They must investigate reports that some argue don't belong with CPS at all. Almost every night, they are ferrying teens from juvenile detention to group homes because their parents won't pick them up. CPS also is used as a pawn in custody battles, with hotline workers taking calls from angry spouses complaining about the other parent when there's no real threat.
The county is now working to reduce a number of departments and to re-organize or re-structure to make the county more efficient, she said.

The menu might also include a half chicken ($22) rubbed with smoky paprika and cooked under a brick, or long, thin links of house-made rabbit sausage ($19) paired with corn and chanterelles.
Baseball's grandest numbers have been devalued because of the steroid era, so 600 is not an automatic guarantee of Hall of Fame induction. Thome also has mostly played batter since rejoining the American League (except for a 17-game stint with the Dodgers) in 2006. But Hall of Famer Paul Molitor was a designated hitter for much of his career. So was Murray.

But what to do about Syria's uprising? Let's start by putting it in historical context. What is happening in Syria, and across the Arab world today, is the first popular movement since the late 19th and early 20th century that has not been animated by foreign policy or anti-colonialism or Israel or Britain. Instead, says Paul Salem, the director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut, "it is about us and our jobs and accountable government. ... It is a profound reorientation to domestic priorities and pragmatism. It is a quest for dignity," emerging from the bottom up."

Catherine Neuschler, a pollution-control planner at the MPCA, defended the state plan, saying it is "a strong step toward meeting our visibility goals."

Footage from last night: Gladys and Tristan seem to be having so much fun together; both of them are grinning from ear to ear. Melissa had fun dancing that routine, even if the judges' comments weren't great. Len and Bruno start singing "Maria" from "West Side Story" as they wait for Maria and Derek to show up. It's kinda cute. Maria admits that if a judge wants in the bedroom, you say yes. I can't believe how much I've warmed up to her since the first of the season.

Everyone has put in their two cents about Fleming's pop efforts and here are two more: It's the material, not the voice that keeps this from being more interesting. You just can't throw Death Cab for Cutie on a program with Ravel and expect it to hold up. The Cohen was most comfortable.
The United States needs to make a concerted effort to reduce the demand for sex trafficking, said Laura Lederer, a former senior adviser on human trafficking at the U.S. Department of State.

Academics maybe, I'm thinking. But also, Majerus, 64, was hospitalized last week.
LeBron James: First of all, I want to win. That's my only thing, my only concern. I've also always prided myself on becoming a better basketball player individually and then taking it onto the court. This is all about winning for me, and I think the Cavs are committed to that. But at the same time, I'll give myself options at this point. Like I said, me and my team—we have a game plan we're going to execute. We'll see what we're at.
Then, last fall, Kansas City learned that it would become unaccredited Jan. 1, bringing the concerns of the Kansas City area into the fray.

Jeffery, a second-round pick out of South Carolina, received a four-year deal. While the exact amount of the contract is not known, the deals are pretty much slotted now. He’s probably getting close to what the Denver Broncos gave safety Rahim Moore, the 45th pick in the 2011 draft, a year ago. Moore received a four-year, $4.448 million contract. The deal included a $1.73 million signing bonus.
Forsman noted that the Case-Shiller numbers track sales in 28 counties in metro Atlanta, as far-flung as Pike and Carroll counties, and that some neighborhoods show bright spots. Most are in an upside-down triangle starting in Atlanta and going north between I-75 and I-85.

Too cute. But with that kind of money, her cup, or cups, would have runneth over with greenbacks. And that's a lot of money for 2011, let alone 1911, so my question would have been: "Where was she going with the cash?"

And to think, the Bears had been faring better against Rodgers than most NFL teams. But they usually have to reel him in over the course of the game. In last season's NFC Championship Game, Rodgers completed 8 of 11 passes for 148 yards as the Packers opened a 14-0 lead. The Bears eventually caught on - Rodgers was 9-of-19 for 96 yards and two interceptions after that, but the damage was done.
"For us to be playing this well this early in the season, defensively, and to have the offensive chances I know we are going to get is a great feeling," Wilber said. "We just made some early mistakes (on offense). We got about 20 yards out and we'd panic and start taking some shots when we had clear passing lanes to the goal. In the second half, Marquette was limited to basically the one shot on goal (where Silver scored)."
Police departments across the country routinely share information with each other - everything from newfangled weapons to information about wanted criminals.
Quinn publicly acknowledged that over the years, Democrats and Republicans alike failed to set aside enough money to keep up with obligations. And they sometimes sweetened benefits without worrying about how to pay for them.
Boorstin wasn't oblivious to the lure of the pseudo. He understood that the entire society seemed in thrall to its own illusions and to its ability to entertain itself with distractions instead of having to engage in the actual mess of life. He knew that the pseudo could be more exciting, more dramatic, more accessible, more fun and less taxing than the real. He just didn't think it was worth the price, which was to sacrifice living in the real world with real issues, real emotions, real challenges, real experiences and real values — in effect, to give up the true for the gratifying, the exalted for the illusory.

The Bears had every reason to pound their chests after dominating both lines of scrimmage. For the Cal seniors, it was the first victory over Oregon State in their careers.
I doubt it. The commitment to the passing game is there, but I think Ohio State spreads it around too much for any receiver to become the first Buckeye to reach 1,000 receiving yards since Michael Jenkins in 2002. Dane Sanzenbacher is on a pace for 890 yards, DeVier Posey for 789. I expect Posey's numbers to increase, but not enough to get him to 1,000, and remember tight end Jake Stoneburner has been out the last two weeks and is expected to return against Wisconsin, providing another option. I do think Terrelle Pryor could be Ohio State's first 3,000-yard passer since Joe Germaine in 1998.
"Oh," I responded, much as if she'd told me she no longer had need of her left appendages. The pink represented more than just a color - it represented a whole view of the world.

In its way, Cooks County, the new restaurant from chef Daniel Mattern and pastry chef Roxana Jullapat, may seem more of the moment than a place like Ink, which is engaged in the restless mutation that modernism needs to survive. The former Bistro LQ space has a warm, woody vibe, enhanced by exposed rafters and sprays of dried grass that look as if they were lifted from a natural history museum diorama and a much-revised list of wines scrawled on a board. It feels like a wine bar but functions more as a restaurant, with actual appetizers and main courses. The list of farmers at the bottom of the menu rolls on as long as the credits at the end of a Spielberg movie; regulars at Fig, Lucques, Rustic Canyon and Lou will have no problem identifying the provenance of the vegetables.
Simpson chipped in from 35 yards in front of the par-4 eighth green for eagle, and then made Woods shake his head and smile when he holed a 60-foot birdie putt that might have rolled off the 12th green if the cup didn't get in the way. It led to a 7-under 65 for a share of the lead Thursday with Stewart Cink and Ryan Moore.
Bonamici wound up in an animated conversation with one small businesswoman who bluntly asked the would-be congresswoman if she was going to raise her taxes.

More golf: David Frost and Michael Allen birdied nine of the first 13 holes and combined for a nine-under 63 for a share of the second-round lead with Tom Purtzer and Brad Bryant in the Legends of Golf at Savannah, Ga. Bryant and Allen had a 65 to match Frost and Allen at 19-under 125 in the better-ball event. Gil Morgan and Tom Kite (61), Bobby Clampett and Andy North (62), Jay Haas and Fred Couples (63), and Jeff Sluman and Brad Faxon (64) were a stroke back. Allen won at TPC Tampa Bay last week for his second Champions Tour title. ...

She finished at 12-under 276. Meena Lee had a 70 to tie for second with Azahara Munoz at eight under. Munoz finished with a 70.
My surprise did not abate when “Unchained” became “Running With The Devil” and the chairs remained in place. The band sounded healthy. Dave's pipes were in good shape.

Conceptually, the old-school, black-and-white intro to “Dancing in the Streets” was pretty cool, but let’s break this down a little bit. Did Jamar really need all of those patterns happening at the same time in his outfit? Did Cheesa really need to over-sing, again? Did Cee Lo really need that wig? Did Carson Daly really need to do a seconds-long stint as a chipper, American Bandstand-esque host, complete with Buddy Holly glasses? The answer to every question is “no.”

Next, I shall surprise you by citing as a favorable factor the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, which with various affiliated organizations pretty much controls the commercial development of the region. It seems to me that the economic situation out here has forced it, perhaps unconsciously, to acquire a profounder notion of its responsibilities than you will find in most organizations of its kind. The average American chamber of commerce, in my experience with it, is a noisy, tiresome, and exceedingly childish booster affair, with no maturer idea of its function than to bring as many factories'to town as possible, in order that merchants will have more customers, realtors more prospects for their lots, and property more benefit from the unearned increment. That, and a running wrangle with the Interstate Commerce Commission, carried on by the traffic department, over some freight differential enjoyed by a nearby city, is about the extent of its activity. As to whether the factories are desirable, as to whether abolishment of the differential would throw several railroads into bankruptcy, they seldom give a thought; and sometimes, as when one Eastern city proudly announced the advent of a soap factory that had stunk so badly it was run out of another city, you wonder whether they are quite bright.
A few houses north of the pier is the trim cottage where Matt and Brian have their confrontation in the movie. The cottage, with its wraparound porch and cream-colored square columns supporting a green plantation-style roof, is screened from the beach by a low hedge. A small sign in front of the hedge says "Mahalo for respecting our private property" — a response to curiosity-seekers who sometimes get too close, hoping to catch some of the movie vibe. If you go, you would do well to honor the kapu and allow the occupants their privacy.
"That was the message this morning," he said. "We're not going to win this series tonight. We just have to win one game. Then we're both in the same position. That's the focus."
One of the area's more elusive quarterbacks last fall, Paul Rice was an integral part of Gateway Tech's run to the Class 4 quarterfinals.
Gonzalez had already hit two towering homers off N.L. Cy Young winner Clayton Kershaw in the game, and the Dodgers wanted no part of him. So, they went after Giambi, who launched a three-run homer off Scott Elbert in the ninth inning, lifting the Colorado Rockies to an 8-5 win.

Oasis is too big for most Caribbean ports, forcing it to stick with much-sailed territory for now. This winter, it will call at St. Thomas, St. Maarten and Nassau. Beginning in May 2010, it will also offer Western Caribbean itineraries at Cozumel and Costa Maya in Mexico and Labadee, Royal Caribbean's private beach on Haiti. In December 2010, the newly developed port of Falmouth, Jamaica, will replace the Costa Maya stop.
"Both shows were photographed in darkness," writes Kathy Vohland. "The Holmes episode was the worst -- (I) couldn't see what was going on most of the time: Who is this? Where are they? What is that?

James will be compared to Modell, although NBA basketball, of sorts, will continue here, and NFL football, the biggest thing in town by far, did not for three years. Of course Modell should have sold to a local buyer, but he was down to his last resort in order to stay in the game when he moved the Browns to ease his financial burdens. James had plenty of time, at age 25, to redeem his feeble efforts against Boston. Garnett, for example, stayed a decade in a less competitive situation in Minnesota and left more honorably.

A close review of nearly three-dozen Northeast Ohio school districts asking for money on the Nov. 2 ballot reveals that even traditionally excellent districts are imperiled by a shrinking tax base, rising numbers of needy and disabled students, galloping costs for special education, equipment, textbooks and services and a tide of new and unfunded state mandates.

Sparkling: Don't aim for Champagne at this price, but you should still drink like it's Champagne. And so I tapped the 2008 Raventos i Blanc de Nit Cava Rosado ($20, 12%, Vinos Unico). Raventos continues to make cava that easily rivals Champagne, and the de Nit rosé finds extra depth by adding a touch of red Monastrell (Mourvedre) to the typical mix, giving it an earthy depth. Hell, you could drink this all through the meal.

Miller's family said he never thought of looking anywhere else.
This is politics and sorry, Mr. Fletcher, but you will be the enemy of anyone wanting the (pension) status quo to remain. This enemy is time-tested, highly savvy, backed by a lot of money and very powerful. Our city needs a very savvy and shrewd politician with knowledge of laws, economics, the environment and governmental affairs and has to possess the kind of political will that our city needs today to get the major problems solved during the next term, not four terms from how. Our next mayor needs to have solid and sound political experience, the kind you get working in a functional and healthy political system, not the kind you get in a system like we have at the state level in California. – Paul Jester, San Diego
A compromise that gives juvenile fare jumpers time to pay a $50 fine before being referred to juvenile court appears to be working well. But treating adult fare evasion as a criminal offense, with fines and court costs that can easily vault to $150 or more, is excessive.

Quizzed about his home run total, Fielder said, "It's not magic. ... How many should I have right now?" In other words, there's plenty of time to produce big numbers, and it's not as if he's in a funk like Albert Pujols, that other $200 million-plus free agent.

"There were — any policeman could tell you — those who were preordained to fiery deaths," Means writes in "The Gulch," a story about three high school boys who murder a fourth by crucifying him, "those most certain to be found in a ditch outside of town, those whose future lay out there like a bear trap, ready to snap shut when the right amount of pressure was applied in just the right spot." That's a hard truth, but it seems to me entirely accurate, a recognition of futility from which Means does not avert his gaze.

The only thing I found amiss when I stopped for a visit Thursday was the empty and collapsing house of Bettye Hamilton, the chain-smoking, wise-cracking lady who lived directly across the street from Sowell. She died last year at the age of 62. She struck me as a good citizen in a transient neighborhood, where too few people take the time to know their neighbors.
Hey, Brian: Jackson is an exciting playmaker, to be sure. With him comes the issue of character. He has made it clear he is unhappy with his contract and he has put himself above his team. On Thursday night, he looked like he quit on his teammates. I wouldn't want to bring aboard the reincarnation of Andre Rison. Heckert knows him better than anyone in Cleveland. My gut feeling is Heckert would stay away from him.

"You're right," answered Scott. "It would be, in many ways, like debt."
That ban dovetails with the most controversial element of the act and the key issue facing the Supreme Court - the mandate requiring most people to have health insurance starting in 2014.

The decision came weeks after the NCAA denied McCay’s original request for a hardship waiver that would have allowed him to play this fall after transferring from Oklahoma in January.

Current situation: Builders got swamped when the wave finally broke. Some firms failed or had to reorganize. On Wall Street, homebuilders got slammed, with a Dow Jones index of home-construction stocks losing 70 percent of its value since its inception in May 2006. But industry employment hasn't suffered as much as predicted because commercial and public projects have taken up some slack.

 Alarm your home for carbon monoxide. Portable power generators  often pushed into service during major outages  can be a source of deadly CO gas. California law now requires CO alarms in most homes, too. Like smoke alarms, these battery-operated alarms should be installed on every floor of a house and in each sleeping area, say safety experts. Consider a battery- operated, portable travel CO alarm for the emergency kit.

Going strong: The genetic research done in Scripps Health's Wellderly Study seeks to understand why some folks remain physically healthy and mentally alert into their 9th and 10th decades while others don't. If Scripps needs more guinea pigs, it might be wise to look inward. Two physicians long associated with Scripps, well up in their 80s, are still practicing medicine: John Carson and David Roseman, both 85. A third, Herman Froeb, 87, is recently retired, but still sees the occasional patient . . .

I did become far more cautious after researching and writing (and rewriting) "Over the Edge." Now every hazard leaps out at me as if in a special effects moment in a movie. I do recognize every place in the canyon where someone has died (like seeing those little crosses along the highway), usually by name of the victim. "Oh yeah," I find myself thinking, "this is where so-and-so died while trying to swim down to camp and drowned." This would seem to suggest that my personal experience might be unpleasant or terrifying as a guide, but in fact it is no different than driving in dangerous traffic where you understand the consequences of screwing up or letting your attention lapse. I love the canyon -- the whitewater and the fantastic hikes -- despite the dangers they pose. And because I know those dangers well and know how to neutralize them easily, I still enjoy immensely the beauty and treasures they offer. My safety talks to clients, however, definitely have lengthened. They used to be long. Now they are longer.
Two of his executive orders — including the campaign restrictions on unions — have been challenged. He might be back in court over the $1.3 billion in school funding that he is proposing to cut this year and next.
"When you look at it, it looks pretty dangerous because you're behind the wheel of a car when most kids don't even have their licenses," Bohn said. "But when you see how we're strapped in - we have straps going everywhere, coming down and across so tight - that we can hardly move. Plus a helmet, fire suit, and neck brace so we're pretty well covered."
What happened next is the stuff of myth. The four men jammed for hours, recording a raft of blues, gospel, bluegrass and country tunes that Colin Escott, a pop-music scholar and co-creator of "Million Dollar Quartet," has called "a catechism of where rock 'n' roll comes from."

Because some of the damage from the August storms affected the brick sidewalks along the Cohansey at the Riverwalk Senior Housing complex, a scope of work needed to be set in place for those repairs.

The driver, described by the victim as a man in his early 20s with a thin build, offered the woman a ride. After she got into the vehicle, he propositioned her for sex, Hart said.

A growing body of research shows the gut affects bodily functions far beyond digestion. Studies have shown intriguing links from the gut's health to bone formation, learning and memory and even conditions including Parkinson's disease.

"I'm hoping we can pick up some lessons about things we can do here in Michigan. One I've already sort of identified is what they're doing with skilled tradespeople and the schooling and training curriculum. I'd love to learn more, because we need more skilled tradespeople here," he said.
Even if a genie granted you omniscience and you could prove you suffered greater consequences than she, your consequences would still be your business, and hers would be hers. Here's what you do know: You tried to heal something in you by having an affair, and now you want to heal something in you by punishing your mistress. Isn't it time to recognize that looking elsewhere for healing won't work?
4. Bottlegate -- Displeasure at an overturned fourth-down conversion in the red zone in the final minute on replay led to a long delay, while beer bottles, hurled by angry fans, decorated the turf. Had Quincy Morgan either (a) caught the ball or (b) not preened and made the "first down" arm signal, the Browns would have either (a) converted or (b) got the next play off before the replay official intervened. The Jaguars won, 15-10, in 2001. Post-game discussion was enlivened by the assertion of Carmen Policy, the Browns' president, that "those bottles are plastic. They don't pack much of a wallop."

"It passes through a remarkably fertile country, and in some places is a considerable road. As I understand it, the Chinese government at Pekin is to raze the wall and construct on its site a remarkably fine roadway through all the country that the wall traverses.

Regardless, the prosecutor said, it's not uncommon for families to be reluctant in cases that involve close friends.
"The Cubs will be heavenly in '67ly!" Ernie Banks enthused. Sounded right to me. That was the year my parents first allowed me to go to the ballpark without parental supervision. It was day baseball, they figured, and walking distance, safe enough if I went with a friend like Billy Foster or Casey Dinges. Little did the adults know that their darling fourth-graders would spend a chunk of their summer days in the company of bartenders, guys just off the graveyard shift, unemployed layabouts, lesbians (though we recognized them only as nice ladies who knew a ton about sports and came even when it wasn't Ladies Day), and pimply faced, beer-swilling juvenile delinquents who always out-raced me over the bleacher benches to batting practice balls. These fine fans, the source of much valuable information about life, were soon to be immortalized as the Bleacher Bums.
There were redeeming things going on all over Bronco Stadium on Thursday. If you look closely you can even see an Oregon media support staffer trying to stop the raging running back as Blount moved toward some Boise State fans. That takes smarts, and guts.
Braun had connected for two loud outs earlier in the game, driving balls to the 400 foot mark in center field and another about 395 feet from home plate. Both were caught by Robinson for outs. Braun's homer over the left-center wall traveled an estimated 405 feet, according to the Brewers.

Philips is looking to fill 50 positions, including those at its Highland Heights campus.
Other prospects, such as UConn center Andre Drummond and Ohio State power forward Jared Sullinger, have questions about them. This is one reason the Pistons are satisfied with picking ninth if they don't get the No. 1 pick in the May 30 draft lottery.
The most important thing about them these days, though, is their role in job creation. Since 1980, businesses less than five years old have accounted for all of the net job creation in America. The fast-growing ones create 10 percent of all new jobs even though they account for only 1 percent of all companies. Without entrepreneurs, job growth in America would be doomed.
I sent an email to an old college friend whom I know to be a fanatical Sabres fan the other day, after Buffalo’s manic rush for the eighth seed came up short with a gut-slashing loss to the Flyers. I received an automated response, the kind you usually get when someone’s on vacation. All it said was this:

Quick note: How in the heck did we ever live without DVR recordings? I only wish you could DVR real life. Sometimes, when my wife is on a rant, I wish I could pause her or fast-forward to the good parts.
“Romney doesn’t show passion. His campaign is missing passion,’’ said the former three-term senator.
Luchita's, 3456 West 117th St., Cleveland, 216-252-1169; Luchita's Parma, 7431 Ridge Road (south of Pleasant Valley Road); 440-743-7650: This spicy institution will celebrate Cinco de Mayo by doing its annual rollout of chiles en nogada -- a traditional dish of poblano chiles filled with picadillo (ground meat, fruits and spices) and topped with a walnut-based cream sauce and pomegranate seeds.

Where to see it: Need to see what orange room accents look like? Several Valley retailers and restaurants are ahead on this trend, using orange to entice customers. The Zo�s Kitchen and Jamba Juice franchises use orange liberally. Le Grande Orange in Arcadia uses pops of orange in its store and logo. Tory Burch, at Scottsdale Fashion Square, utilizes orange decor (mixed with white, gold and pink tones) to draw in shoppers.
Bernanke sought to bolster confidence on Wall Street and in Congress that once the economy is strong enough, the Fed has the tools and the will to raise rates and withdraw stimulus aid -- without causing another recession. The goal would be to prevent another speculative asset bubble from forming, such as in stocks or commodities, and ward off inflation.

He said the school district transports approximately 915 general education students and 707 special education students on a daily basis of the estimated 32,000 total across 42 schools.
“It's just a political moment,” he said of Romney’s comments. “You know there's the quality of political debate, you know, about economic policy is really terrible. It's not surprising given it's a campaign, but we have to govern in facts and, you know, the debate we should be having is, again, what's the right policies to make the economy stronger?”

Cozy cafe across the street from McGovern’s. Good sandwiches, veggie dishes, excellent coffee. I’m partial to the muffins and other baked goods. If it’s nice out, they open the outdoor patio upstairs. Within easy walking distance of the train station.
And it’s always a pleasure to see Anjelica Huston — although you wish she’d been given more to do as Gordon-Levitt’s worrywart mom. Anna Kendrick is very sweet as his therapist, too (although she seems more like an idealized kid sister than a real woman) and the great Philip Baker Hall shines as a chemo patient with a taste for invective.
Let it go without saying,
If someone called central casting for a logger, they'd dispatch Ken Wilson. He's in his early 60s, thickset, with chin stubble, plaid shirt and suspenders holding up work pants. Glad for the company in the cab of his Rottne H-20 harvester, he engages in a running commentary on his work.

The narrator of Dylan Hicks' first novel, "Boarded Windows," knows a lot. In a couple of pages, he might cite Goethe's Young Werther on Ossian, paraphrase Gogol, refer to Cartesian duality and songs like "Surrey With the Fringe on Top" and "Ol' Man River," compare someone's hair to Schopenhauer's or Bozo's, and offer a Charles Mingus anecdote. He speaks of a backroom Bakunin and a Lachaise sculpture, quotes Wallace Stevens and Duke Ellington, and uses "digital hegemons," "asymptote" and "lachrymatory" in passing. But for all that, the narrator (who is nameless) doesn't know enough. He doesn't know what he needs to know -- that is, where he fits into his own story, which is far too focused on somebody else, a sort of father figure named Wade Salem.
Yankee captain Derek Jeter went one step further. He had declared Thursday that Rivera would return, even when the pitcher himself seemed unsure. Jeter is usually measured and deliberate but he spoke with emotion and instinct—he simply knew Rivera wouldn't quit.
"We've finally reached the point where I'm just really satisfied with the way the music is being presented," Curtis says. "That excitement sort of transferred into us basically taking every single show we could get." He paused on a whirlwind "Ghostory" tour to talk with the Free Press.

Audiences are, however, sensitive to the architectural magnificence of the Palais Garnier.

In Minoso's case, Weinberg and videographer-editor Joel Cohen are wrapping up production on a documentary on the former White Sox star, which they hope to premiere by fall 2012. Weinberg and Cohen have talked with ESPN, the Major League Baseball Network and local stations about running the documentary, although they still need to raise another $20,000 to complete post-production on the film, which Weinberg says could run about 90 minutes.

Regulators also dropped a proposal to require that airlines include their customer-service promises in their legal contracts with passengers. While it sounds bureaucratic, consumer groups say it will be an important step in forcing airlines to live up to their promises.
But I'm not complaining, even though I'm not that optimistic that we'll still be talking about music at the fronton by Christmas. Not with a lineup boasting Strawberry Festival-worthy acts such as Lee Ann Womack and the Oak Ridge Boys. I really need shortcake in the mix.
Some City Council members and staff suspected that the arena at 1490 E. County Road E was under-performing financially, but the complexity of the bond financing and confusion over the ownership arrangement made it difficult to get a grasp on the depth of the problems.

Some have questioned whether the mayor's 2020 deadline is attainable. Austin Beutner, a mayoral candidate who served two years ago as the DWP's interim general manager, said the city's longtime reliance on coal makes getting off of it extremely complicated. He said Villaraigosa's no-coal commitment, announced with much fanfare during his 2009 inaugural address, was probably "the triumph of politics over pragmatism."

I, however, have learned a great deal about life through my non-verbal daughter, an adolescent who requires complete care. Through this journey I hold one conviction: that every human here on earth has a purpose, a life, a contribution to make, and we should not judge the quality of someone’s life because their cognitive capacity is “less than” the norm.

The official provided no motive for the killings.

The results must be filtered a bit, too. The Cardinals played in the Super Bowl the previous season, meaning their selections came near the bottom of every round. That's an obvious disadvantage.
Instead of focusing on Albert and his contract, perhaps we should think about the needs of the vulnerable members of our community and those who work with them. I'm thinking about those living in poverty, the homeless, the mentally and physically challenged, victims of abuse and neglect and other froms of violence. Of course, worrying about Albert and his contract is easier than thinking about these individuals. While Albert and other professional athletes entertain us for the duration of a season, a large cadre of dedicated people work daily providing needed services to our vulnerable neighbors. The case managers at agecnies like Places for People/Community Alternatives help people deal with the challenges of everyday living. Volunteers provide pro bono counseling services to victims of torture and war trauma. Staff and volunteers run after school programs for at risk youth. These are but a few examples. The critical work of these people goes unnoticed. Service providers employed in public and private agencies continure to work for wages that don't begin to reflect the importance of their contribution to the welfare of the St. Louis community.

"They are the ones who apply federal immigration law," Bender said. "If they take the position that Arizona law interferes with the operation of federal immigration, I would think that should be very persuasive with the judge." Bender said lawsuits filed against state and local governments by the federal government are not unusual but are more common in cases of civil rights issues than immigration. The U.S. Supreme Court, at the request of the U.S. solicitor general, last month agreed to hear arguments on the constitutionality of Arizona's 2007 law that penalizes employers for hiring illegal immigrants. That law has been upheld in U.S. District Court and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Word of Tuesday's lawsuit brought out politicians and activists to condemn and praise the federal government's action.

I tend to be a bit sheepish with my answer. "Well," I say, scanning the room for exits, "I'm doing the course of study for ordination in my denomination."

At ALEC conferences, reporters are welcome to attend policy seminars, breakfasts and lunches. There’s no way to see how model bills are written, though, because those sessions are strictly off-limits to nonmembers. ALEC’s two governing boards have the final say on what gets approved — one is made up of lawmakers, the other of corporate officials.
